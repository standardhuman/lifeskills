# Tax Mitigation

## Overview

Legal strategies to reduce your tax burden through smart planning, timing, and account usage. The goal isn't to evade taxes but to use the tax code as designed - keeping more of what you earn through legitimate means. Every dollar saved in taxes is a dollar that compounds in your investments.

**When to use**: Tax planning throughout year, before major financial decisions, year-end tax optimization, high income years, windfall events

## Quick Reference

| Strategy | Benefit | Best For |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Retirement contributions | Reduce taxable income | Everyone |
| HSA contributions | Triple tax advantage | High-deductible plan holders |
| Tax-loss harvesting | Offset gains | Investors with taxable accounts |
| Charitable giving | Deductions | Those who itemize |
| Business expenses | Reduce business income | Self-employed |
| Timing income/deductions | Control brackets | Variable income |

## Key Tax Reduction Strategies

### 1. Maximize Retirement Contributions

**401(k) / 403(b)**:
- Traditional: Reduces current taxable income dollar-for-dollar
- 2024 limit: $23,000 ($30,500 if 50+)
- $23,000 contribution in 24% bracket saves $5,520 in taxes

**Traditional IRA**:
- Deductible if income below limits (or no workplace plan)
- 2024 limit: $7,000 ($8,000 if 50+)

**SEP-IRA / Solo 401(k)** (self-employed):
- SEP: Up to 25% of net self-employment income
- Solo 401(k): Employee + employer contributions
- Can contribute up to $69,000 in 2024

**AskUserQuestion**: "Are you maxing out your tax-advantaged retirement accounts?"

### 2. Health Savings Account (HSA)

**Triple tax advantage**:
1. Contributions are tax-deductible
2. Growth is tax-free
3. Withdrawals for medical expenses are tax-free

**2024 limits**: $4,150 individual / $8,300 family (+$1,000 if 55+)

**Strategy**: Pay medical expenses out of pocket, let HSA grow, reimburse yourself in retirement (keep receipts forever)

**Requirements**: Must have high-deductible health plan (HDHP)

### 3. Tax-Loss Harvesting

**How it works**:
1. Sell investments at a loss
2. Use losses to offset gains (and up to $3,000 of ordinary income)
3. Buy similar (not identical) investment to maintain position
4. Carry forward unused losses indefinitely

**Example**:
- You have $10,000 in capital gains
- You sell a losing position for $7,000 loss
- Net taxable gain: $3,000 (saves ~$1,500 in taxes at 15% rate)

**Watch out**: Wash sale rule - can't buy substantially identical security within 30 days

**AskUserQuestion**: "Do you have any investments currently at a loss that we could harvest?"

### 4. Charitable Giving Strategies

**Bunching donations**:
- Combine multiple years of giving into one year
- Itemize in bunched year, standard deduction in other years
- Example: Give $24,000 every other year instead of $12,000 annually

**Donor-Advised Fund (DAF)**:
- Contribute and get immediate tax deduction
- Distribute to charities over time
- Great for bunching strategy

**Appreciated stock donation**:
- Donate stock that has gained value
- Deduct full market value
- Avoid capital gains tax entirely
- Best way to give if you have appreciated investments

**Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD)** (age 70.5+):
- Donate directly from IRA to charity (up to $105,000)
- Counts toward Required Minimum Distribution
- Excluded from taxable income

### 5. Business/Self-Employment Strategies

**Deductible expenses**:
- Home office (dedicated space)
- Vehicle (actual expenses or standard mileage)
- Equipment and supplies
- Professional development
- Health insurance premiums
- Retirement contributions

**S-Corp election** (if income >$60K):
- Pay yourself reasonable salary
- Take remaining profit as distribution
- Avoid self-employment tax on distribution portion
- Example: $120K profit → $70K salary + $50K distribution saves ~$7,650 in SE tax

**Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction**:
- 20% deduction on qualified business income
- Phase-outs apply at higher income levels
- Can be substantial for pass-through businesses

### 6. Income Timing Strategies

**Defer income**:
- Delay year-end invoices to January (if income will be lower next year)
- Defer bonus to next year if possible
- Exercise stock options strategically

**Accelerate deductions**:
- Prepay state taxes (up to SALT limit)
- Make January mortgage payment in December
- Bunch medical expenses (if over 7.5% AGI threshold)

**Bracket management**:
- Know your bracket boundaries
- Convert Traditional to Roth IRA to "fill up" lower brackets
- Realize capital gains in low-income years

## Tax-Advantaged Account Types

| Account | Contribution | Growth | Withdrawal |
|---------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Traditional 401k/IRA | Tax-deductible | Tax-deferred | Taxed |
| Roth 401k/IRA | After-tax | Tax-free | Tax-free |
| HSA | Tax-deductible | Tax-free | Tax-free* |
| 529 Plan | After-tax** | Tax-free | Tax-free* |
| Taxable Brokerage | After-tax | Taxed | Taxed |

*For qualified expenses
**Some states offer deduction

## Year-End Tax Checklist

Review before December 31:

```
□ Max out 401(k) contributions
□ Make IRA contribution (or set up for next year)
□ Max HSA if eligible
□ Review taxable accounts for loss harvesting
□ Consider Roth conversion if in low bracket
□ Bunch charitable donations if beneficial
□ Use FSA funds before expiration
□ Contribute to 529 if state deduction available
□ Review estimated tax payments
□ Consider accelerating deductions
□ Review business expenses (self-employed)
```

## Key Principles

**Why it works**:
- **Legal tax code provisions**: These strategies use the tax code as designed
- **Compounding benefit**: Tax savings invested = decades of additional growth
- **Bracket awareness**: Knowing your bracket enables strategic decisions
- **Time value**: Tax-deferred = more money working for you now

**Tax planning vs. tax preparation**:
- **Preparation** (April): Recording what happened
- **Planning** (year-round): Strategically managing what happens

**The real goal**: Minimize lifetime taxes, not just this year's taxes. Sometimes paying more now (Roth) saves more later.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Letting the tax tail wag the dog**: Don't make bad financial decisions for tax reasons. Save taxes on good decisions.

- **Ignoring state taxes**: Federal strategies may not apply to state. Consider state-specific opportunities.

- **Missing deadlines**: Retirement contributions, estimated payments, and elections have firm deadlines.

- **Over-contributing**: Excess contributions face penalties. Know and track limits.

- **Forgetting about AMT**: High-income earners may face Alternative Minimum Tax that reduces some deductions.

- **Not adjusting withholding**: Owing too much or getting big refund means your withholding is wrong.

## When to Get Professional Help

Consider a CPA or tax advisor for:
- Income over $200,000
- Self-employment income
- Stock options or RSUs
- Real estate investments
- Business ownership
- Inheritance or windfall
- Major life changes
- Multi-state income

**Cost-benefit**: A good advisor often saves more than their fee.

## Examples

**Example 1: W-2 employee optimization**

**Situation**: $90,000 salary, 22% bracket, not maxing retirement

**Current taxes**: ~$12,000 federal

**Optimization**:
1. Increase 401(k) from $6,000 to $15,000: Saves $1,980
2. Open HSA and max ($4,150): Saves $913
3. Total tax savings: $2,893/year

**Net cost**: Contributing $13,150 more but only reducing take-home by ~$10,257 (tax savings subsidize contributions)

---

**Example 2: Self-employed tax reduction**

**Situation**: $150,000 net self-employment income

**Without optimization**: ~$32,000 federal + $21,200 SE tax = $53,200

**With optimization**:
1. Max SEP-IRA ($37,500): Saves $9,000 income tax
2. S-Corp election: Saves ~$8,000 SE tax
3. Home office deduction ($5,000): Saves $1,200
4. Health insurance deduction ($8,000): Saves $1,920
5. Total savings: ~$20,120

**After optimization**: ~$33,080 total tax (38% reduction)

**Example 3: High earner Roth conversion strategy**

**Situation**: Taking a sabbatical year, income dropping from $200K to $30K

**Strategy**:
- Normally in 32% bracket, this year in 12% bracket
- Convert $50,000 Traditional IRA to Roth
- Pay ~$6,000 in taxes now (12%)
- Avoid ~$16,000 in taxes later (32%)
- Net savings: $10,000 in lifetime taxes

**Key insight**: Low-income years are opportunities for Roth conversion

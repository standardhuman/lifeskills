# Weekly Review

## Before Starting (Optional)

If you're feeling unclear or have mixed feelings about this:
- **Feeling stuck or overwhelmed?** → Try self-connection first to process what's weighing on you
- **Unsure what direction to take?** → Try design-exploration first
- **Ready to review and plan?** → Continue to Phase 1 below

## Overview

GTD-based structured reflection to clear your mind, process open loops, and set priorities for the coming week. Prevents drift, overwhelm, and the feeling of being "always behind."

**When to use**: Friday afternoon, end of week, feeling scattered with multiple priorities, planning next week

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Action | Time |
|-------|--------|------|
| 1. Collect | Gather all open loops | 10 min |
| 2. Process | Clarify each item | 15 min |
| 3. Review | Look at calendar & projects | 15 min |
| 4. Plan | Set 3 priorities for next week | 10 min |
| 5. Complete | Update systems, commit | 5 min |

**Total time**: ~45-60 minutes

## The Process

Copy this checklist using TodoWrite to track progress:

```
□ Phase 1: Collect (gather open loops)
□ Phase 2: Process (clarify items)
□ Phase 3: Review (calendar & projects)
□ Phase 4: Plan (set priorities)
□ Phase 5: Complete (update systems)
```

### Phase 1: Collect (10 minutes)

Gather everything that has your attention. Don't process yet, just collect.

**Actions**:
1. Empty all inboxes (email, Slack, texts, notes apps, browser tabs)
2. Write down everything on your mind
3. Ask yourself: "What am I not remembering?"
4. Capture physical items (papers on desk, sticky notes)
5. Create one master list of all open loops

**AskUserQuestion**: "Take 10 minutes to collect. What's pulling on your attention?"

**Why separate collection**: When you try to process while collecting, your mind keeps generating new items. Collect everything first, then process with a clear end in sight.

### Phase 2: Process (15 minutes)

Clarify what each item actually is. Still not doing the work, just deciding what it is.

**For each item**:
1. Is this actionable?
   - **If YES**: What's the very next physical action? (Be specific: "Email John re: proposal" not "deal with John situation")
   - **If NO**: Is it reference (file it), trash (delete it), or someday/maybe (list for later)?
2. Write the next action or file appropriately

**Common mistakes**:
- "Think about X" is not an action → "Write 3 options for X"
- "Project Y" is not an action → "Draft project Y outline"
- Processing = deciding what it is, NOT doing it

**Tool**: Use AskUserQuestion to guide through each item

### Phase 3: Review (15 minutes)

Look backward and forward to gain perspective.

**Looking back (past week)**:
1. What happened? Any wins to celebrate?
2. What took longer than expected? Why?
3. What lessons did you learn?
4. What worked well that you want to continue?

**Looking forward (coming week)**:
1. Check calendar for all appointments, deadlines, commitments
2. Review project list - what needs to move forward?
3. Check waiting-for list - any follow-ups needed?
4. Any upcoming events that need preparation?

**AskUserQuestion**: "What happened last week? What's coming up next week?"

### Phase 4: Plan (10 minutes)

Set focused priorities based on your review.

**Actions**:
1. Looking at all your actions and commitments, what are the **3 most important** things to accomplish next week?
2. For each priority:
   - Is it really important? (Eisenhower matrix: important + urgent, or important + not urgent)
   - When will you do it? (Schedule specific time blocks)
   - What's the first step?
3. Write priorities somewhere visible (whiteboard, sticky note, daily note)

**The 80% rule**: Only schedule 80% of your time. Leave 20% for unexpected but important items.

**AskUserQuestion with time-block scheduling**: "What are your 3 priorities? Let's schedule time blocks for each."

### Phase 5: Complete (5 minutes)

Update your systems and commit to your priorities.

**Actions**:
1. Clear completed items from task list
2. File processed reference materials
3. Update project status (if using project management tool)
4. Write priorities on whiteboard or visible location
5. Close all browser tabs
6. Clean physical workspace
7. **Commit to your priorities** (say them out loud or write them down)

**Completion criteria**:
- Mind feels clear ✓
- Priorities are set ✓
- Systems are updated ✓
- Ready for Monday ✓

## Key Principles

**Source**: David Allen's "Getting Things Done" (GTD) methodology

**Why it works**:
- **Separation of collection and processing** prevents overwhelm (mind stops generating when it knows you've captured everything)
- **Mind like water** - your mind is clear when everything is in a trusted system
- **Review prevents surprises** - looking at calendar and projects eliminates "oh no, that's this week?"
- **Planning from calm state** produces better priorities than reactive fire-fighting

**The GTD workflow**: Capture → Clarify → Organize → Reflect → Engage

This skill implements the "Reflect" step, which is the foundation for effective "Engage."

## Common Pitfalls

- **"I'm too busy for this"**: This is exactly when it's most valuable. The 1 hour invested saves 5+ hours of thrashing and context-switching. When you feel too busy, that's your signal to do a review.

- **Processing while collecting**: Your mind keeps generating new items when you try to process simultaneously. Collect everything first (empty your mind), then process with a clear end in sight.

- **Skipping review of past week**: You repeat mistakes when you don't learn from them. The 5 minutes reviewing last week prevents hours of future problems.

- **Setting too many priorities**: "If everything is a priority, nothing is." Three priorities is realistic. Ten priorities guarantees nothing meaningful gets done. Be ruthless.

- **Not scheduling time blocks**: "I'll work on my priorities when I have time" = they won't happen. Schedule specific time blocks or they'll get crowded out by urgent-but-not-important tasks.

- **Doing the work during processing**: Processing is deciding what something is, not doing it. If you start doing tasks, you'll never finish the review and your mind stays cluttered.

## Examples

**Example 1: Overwhelmed startup founder**

**Situation**: Friday 4pm, feeling scattered, 47 browser tabs open, unclear what to focus on next week

**Collection**: Listed 52 items (emails, Slack messages, ideas, half-finished work, worries)

**Processing**:
- 15 were already done (just needed to be checked off)
- 10 were not actionable (reference or trash)
- 27 real next actions identified

**Review**:
- Past week: Launched feature but took 2x expected time due to unclear requirements
- Coming week: 8 commitments including investor meeting Thursday

**Planning**: Chose 3 priorities:
1. Prepare investor deck (scheduled Tuesday 9am-12pm)
2. Define clear requirements for next feature (scheduled Wednesday 2pm-4pm)
3. Team retro on launch delays (scheduled Monday 3pm)

**Outcome**: Clear mind, 3 focused priorities with time blocks, 47 browser tabs → 3 tabs

**Example 2: Creative professional feeling scattered**

**Situation**: End of week, 6 projects "in progress" but none actually moving forward

**Collection**: 43 items across all 6 projects

**Processing**: Realized 4 projects were "someday/maybe" not "active now"

**Review**:
- Past week: Context-switching between all 6 projects meant no deep work
- Coming week: Client deadline Wednesday, need focused time

**Planning**:
1. Chose ONE primary project for next week (client deadline)
2. Put 5 other projects on "paused" list (guilt-free)
3. Scheduled 3 deep work blocks for primary project

**Outcome**: Permission to focus on one thing, actual progress vs. spinning plates

**Example 3: Preventing Sunday evening anxiety**

**Situation**: Weekly review done Friday afternoon

**Result**:
- Sunday evening: Calm and ready (vs. usual Sunday dread)
- Monday morning: Hit the ground running (vs. scrambling to remember what's urgent)
- Week productivity: 40% improvement in meaningful work completed

**Key insight**: The Sunday dread comes from "I don't know what's coming and I'm not ready." Weekly review on Friday eliminates that.

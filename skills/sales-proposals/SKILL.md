# Sales & Proposals

## Overview

Framework for consultative selling and creating winning proposals. The goal isn't to convince people to buy - it's to help qualified prospects make the right decision. Great sales is about understanding needs deeply and presenting solutions clearly. If the fit is right, the sale is natural.

**When to use**: Writing proposals, preparing for sales calls, improving close rate, handling objections, following up with prospects

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Goal | Key Actions |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Qualify | Right fit? | Discovery questions, assess alignment |
| Discover | Understand | Deep needs analysis, pain points |
| Present | Show solution | Tailored proposal, value articulation |
| Close | Get decision | Address concerns, ask for commitment |
| Follow-up | Stay top of mind | Systematic outreach, add value |

## The Sales Process

### Phase 1: Qualify

Determine if this prospect is worth pursuing.

**Qualification criteria (BANT)**:
- **B**udget: Can they afford your solution?
- **A**uthority: Is this the decision maker?
- **N**eed: Do they have a problem you solve?
- **T**iming: Are they ready to act?

**Qualifying questions**:
- "What's driving your interest in solving this now?"
- "Who else is involved in this decision?"
- "What's your timeline for making a decision?"
- "What budget range are you working with?"
- "What happens if you don't solve this problem?"

**Red flags** (consider passing):
- No budget or unwilling to discuss
- Not the decision maker and won't connect you
- Problem doesn't match your solution
- "Just exploring" with no urgency
- Previous bad experience they're holding against you

**AskUserQuestion**: "Tell me about this prospect. What do you know about their situation?"

### Phase 2: Discover

Understand their situation deeply.

**Discovery framework**:
1. **Current state**: Where are they now?
2. **Desired state**: Where do they want to be?
3. **Gap**: What's preventing them from getting there?
4. **Impact**: What does the gap cost them?
5. **Urgency**: Why solve it now?

**Powerful discovery questions**:
- "Walk me through how you currently handle [problem]..."
- "What's working well? What's not?"
- "What have you tried before? Why didn't it work?"
- "If you could wave a magic wand, what would change?"
- "What does this problem cost you?" (time, money, stress, opportunity)
- "What's at stake if this doesn't get solved?"

**Listen more than you talk**: 70% listening, 30% asking questions. Take notes. Repeat back what you hear.

**Uncover the real problem**: Often the stated problem isn't the real problem. Keep asking "why" and "tell me more."

### Phase 3: Present

Show how you solve their specific problem.

**Presentation structure**:
1. **Situation summary**: "Here's what I heard..."
2. **Implications**: "This is costing you..."
3. **Solution**: "Here's how we'd solve it..."
4. **Evidence**: "Here's how it's worked for others..."
5. **Investment**: "Here's what it costs..."
6. **Next steps**: "Here's how we'd start..."

**Key principle**: Only present what's relevant to THEIR situation. Generic pitches lose. Tailored solutions win.

**Use their language**: Mirror the words they used in discovery. Shows you listened.

### Phase 4: Close

Help them make a decision.

**Trial close**: Test readiness before asking
- "How does this sound so far?"
- "Does this address your main concerns?"
- "Can you see how this would work for you?"

**Ask for the business**:
- "Would you like to move forward?"
- "What would you need to make a decision?"
- "Shall I send over the agreement?"

**Handle objections** (see section below)

**Create urgency** (genuine, not manipulative):
- Limited availability
- Price increase coming
- Cost of delay (their problem continues)
- Quick-start incentive

**After the close**:
- Confirm next steps in writing
- Send agreement promptly
- Make signing/paying easy
- Start strong (great onboarding)

### Phase 5: Follow-up

Most sales are won in follow-up.

**Follow-up statistics**:
- 80% of sales require 5+ follow-ups
- Most salespeople give up after 1-2
- Persistent (not pushy) follow-up wins

**Follow-up rhythm**:
- Day 1: Proposal sent, confirm receipt
- Day 3: Check if they have questions
- Day 7: Add value (case study, article, insight)
- Day 14: Check in, offer call
- Day 21: Direct ask, create gentle urgency
- Day 30+: Move to monthly nurture

**Follow-up that adds value**:
- "Saw this article, thought of our conversation..."
- "Had another client with similar situation, here's what worked..."
- "Quick idea that might help with [their problem]..."

**Know when to stop**: After 6-8 touches with no response, move to quarterly check-in or remove from pipeline.

## Writing Winning Proposals

### Proposal Structure

```
1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (1 page)
   - The situation
   - The solution
   - The investment
   - Why us

2. UNDERSTANDING YOUR SITUATION
   - Their challenge (in their words)
   - Impact of the problem
   - Desired outcome

3. OUR SOLUTION
   - What we'll do
   - How we'll do it
   - Timeline and milestones
   - What you'll get

4. EVIDENCE
   - Relevant case studies
   - Testimonials
   - Credentials

5. INVESTMENT
   - Pricing options (if applicable)
   - What's included
   - Payment terms

6. NEXT STEPS
   - How to move forward
   - Timeline to start
   - What happens next

7. APPENDIX (if needed)
   - Team bios
   - Detailed scope
   - Terms and conditions
```

### Proposal Best Practices

**Make it about them**: Their name/logo on cover, their situation throughout. This isn't about you, it's about solving their problem.

**Lead with the summary**: Decision makers often only read page 1. Make it count.

**Use visuals**: Timeline graphics, before/after comparisons, process diagrams.

**Price positioning**:
- Options are better than single price (gives control)
- Anchor with highest option first
- Show value before price

**Make it easy to say yes**: Clear next steps, simple acceptance process.

## Handling Objections

**Objection framework (LAER)**:
- **L**isten: Let them finish, don't interrupt
- **A**cknowledge: "I understand..." / "That's a fair concern..."
- **E**xplore: "Tell me more..." / "What's behind that?"
- **R**espond: Address with specifics

**Common objections and responses**:

**"It's too expensive"**
- "Compared to what?" (understand their anchor)
- "What's it costing you to not solve this?" (reframe)
- "Which parts are most/least valuable to you?" (unbundle)
- "What would need to be true for this to be worth the investment?" (discover)

**"I need to think about it"**
- "Of course. What specifically do you want to think through?"
- "What questions can I answer to help you decide?"
- "What would help you feel more confident?"

**"We're looking at other options"**
- "That makes sense. What are you comparing?"
- "What criteria are you using to decide?"
- "How can I help you make the best decision?"

**"Now isn't the right time"**
- "What would make it the right time?"
- "What's the cost of waiting?"
- "When would be better, and can I follow up then?"

**"I need to talk to my [partner/team/boss]"**
- "Absolutely. What do you think they'll want to know?"
- "Would it help if I joined that conversation?"
- "What's your recommendation to them?"

## Key Principles

**Why it works**:
- **Consultative approach**: Solving problems, not pushing products
- **Qualification saves time**: Right prospects, right fit
- **Deep discovery**: Understanding creates trust and relevance
- **Persistence pays**: Most give up too early
- **Clear proposals**: Easy to understand, easy to decide

**Sales mindset shifts**:
- Selling is helping, not convincing
- No is often "not yet" or "not this way"
- Rejection isn't personal
- The best salespeople ask better questions
- Price is rarely the real objection

## Common Pitfalls

- **Presenting before discovering**: You can't solve a problem you don't understand. Slow down, ask more questions.

- **Talking too much**: The more you talk, the less you learn. Let them talk.

- **Avoiding the ask**: You have to ask for the business. Directly. It's not pushy, it's helpful.

- **One follow-up and done**: Most deals require multiple touches. Create a systematic follow-up process.

- **Generic proposals**: Copy-paste proposals lose. Each proposal should feel written for this specific prospect.

- **Competing on price**: Unless you're the low-cost leader, competing on price is a race to the bottom.

## Examples

**Example 1: Discovery revealing real problem**

**Initial request**: "We need help with our website"

**Discovery questions**:
- "What's prompting you to look at the website now?"
- "What do you want the website to do that it's not doing?"
- "How do customers typically find you?"

**Real problem uncovered**: Website isn't the issue. They have no way to capture leads, no follow-up system, and are losing potential customers after first contact.

**Expanded solution**: Website + lead capture + email automation + CRM setup

**Result**: $3,000 website project became $12,000 comprehensive solution that actually solved their problem.

**Example 2: Handling price objection**

**Objection**: "That's more than we expected to spend"

**Response**: "I understand. Can you help me understand what you were expecting? ... [listens] ... What's the cost to your business of not solving this problem for another year? ... [they calculate: $50K+] ... Our solution is $15K. If it even partially solves the problem, the ROI is significant. What would you need to feel confident this is the right investment?"

**Result**: Helped them see value vs. cost, closed the deal.

**Example 3: Follow-up sequence that won**

**Day 1**: Proposal sent, confirmation email
**Day 3**: "Quick check - any questions I can answer?"
**Day 7**: [No response] - Sent relevant case study
**Day 14**: Called, left voicemail: "Want to make sure you have what you need to decide"
**Day 21**: Email: "Saw this article about [their industry] - thought of you"
**Day 28**: Called, connected: "I know you're busy. What questions can I answer?"
**Day 30**: They signed

**Key insight**: They were interested, just busy. Consistent, value-added follow-up kept it alive until they had bandwidth to decide.

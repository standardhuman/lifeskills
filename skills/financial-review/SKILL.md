# Financial Review

## Overview

Periodic financial health check to understand where you stand, track progress toward goals, and make informed decisions. The financial equivalent of a physical - catching issues early and celebrating wins. Takes 30-60 minutes monthly, 2-3 hours annually.

**When to use**: Monthly money date, quarterly review, end of year, before major life decisions, feeling uncertain about financial health

## Quick Reference

| Review Type | Frequency | Time | Focus |
|-------------|-----------|------|-------|
| Weekly | Every week | 10 min | Budget vs. actual |
| Monthly | 1st of month | 30-60 min | Full financial snapshot |
| Quarterly | Every 3 months | 1-2 hours | Goals progress, rebalancing |
| Annual | Year end | 2-3 hours | Net worth, tax planning, goal setting |

## Monthly Review Process

Copy this checklist using TodoWrite to track progress:

```
□ Phase 1: Gather accounts
□ Phase 2: Calculate net worth
□ Phase 3: Review cash flow
□ Phase 4: Check goals progress
□ Phase 5: Identify actions
```

### Phase 1: Gather Accounts (5 minutes)

Pull current balances from all accounts.

**Assets (what you own)**:
- Checking accounts
- Savings accounts
- Investment accounts (brokerage, 401k, IRA)
- Real estate equity (value - mortgage)
- Vehicle value (realistic resale)
- Other valuable property

**Liabilities (what you owe)**:
- Credit card balances
- Student loans
- Car loans
- Mortgage
- Personal loans
- Other debts

**Tool tip**: Use a spreadsheet or app (Personal Capital, Mint) to track automatically

**AskUserQuestion**: "Let's gather your current account balances. What accounts do you have?"

### Phase 2: Calculate Net Worth (5 minutes)

**Net Worth = Total Assets - Total Liabilities**

**Track over time**:
| Date | Assets | Liabilities | Net Worth | Change |
|------|--------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| Jan | $50,000 | $30,000 | $20,000 | - |
| Feb | $51,500 | $29,200 | $22,300 | +$2,300 |

**What matters**: The trend, not the number. A negative net worth moving toward zero is progress. A positive net worth growing is success.

**AskUserQuestion**: "Based on your accounts, your net worth is [X]. How does this compare to last month?"

### Phase 3: Review Cash Flow (15 minutes)

Analyze income vs. expenses for the past month.

**Questions to answer**:
1. Did you spend less than you earned?
2. Which categories were over/under budget?
3. Were there any surprise expenses?
4. How much went to savings/investments?

**Key metrics**:
- **Savings rate**: (Income - Expenses) / Income × 100
  - Target: 20%+ (more is better)
- **Fixed expense ratio**: Fixed Expenses / Income × 100
  - Target: Under 50%

**AskUserQuestion**: "How did last month's spending compare to your budget? Any surprises?"

### Phase 4: Check Goals Progress (10 minutes)

Review progress toward financial goals.

**For each goal, assess**:
1. Target amount and date
2. Current progress (% complete)
3. On track? (current pace will hit goal)
4. Adjustments needed?

**Common goals**:
- Emergency fund (3-6 months expenses)
- Debt payoff (specific debt, target date)
- Retirement (age, amount needed)
- Major purchase (house, car, vacation)
- Financial independence

**Visual tracking**: Progress bars or charts make goals tangible

**AskUserQuestion**: "Let's review your financial goals. What are you working toward?"

### Phase 5: Identify Actions (10 minutes)

Based on review, determine next steps.

**Questions**:
1. What's working well? (Keep doing)
2. What needs adjustment? (Change)
3. What's the #1 priority this month?

**Common actions**:
- Adjust budget categories
- Increase/decrease savings allocation
- Rebalance investments
- Pay extra toward specific debt
- Research better rates (savings, loans)
- Update beneficiaries/estate documents

**AskUserQuestion**: "Based on this review, what's the most important financial action for this month?"

## Key Metrics Dashboard

Track these numbers monthly:

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Net worth | $ | Growing | ↑/↓ |
| Savings rate | % | 20%+ | ✓/✗ |
| Emergency fund | $ | 3-6 mo | X months |
| Debt-to-income | % | <36% | ✓/✗ |
| Investment growth | % | Market | ✓/✗ |

## Quarterly Deep Dive

Every 3 months, add these checks:

**Investment review**:
- Asset allocation still appropriate?
- Rebalancing needed?
- Tax-loss harvesting opportunities?

**Insurance check**:
- Coverage adequate for current situation?
- Better rates available?
- Life changes requiring updates?

**Credit check**:
- Pull free credit report
- Any errors to dispute?
- Credit score trending up?

**Subscription audit**:
- List all recurring charges
- Cancel unused services
- Negotiate better rates

## Annual Review

End of year comprehensive review:

**Tax preparation**:
- Gather all tax documents
- Maximize deductions before year end
- Harvest tax losses
- Contribute to retirement accounts

**Goal setting**:
- Review past year's goals (hit or miss?)
- Set next year's financial goals
- Create action plan for each goal

**Estate planning**:
- Beneficiaries up to date?
- Will/trust current?
- Power of attorney in place?

**Insurance review**:
- Life insurance adequate?
- Disability insurance?
- Umbrella policy needed?

## Key Principles

**Why it works**:
- **Awareness creates control** - You can't manage what you don't measure
- **Trends matter more than snapshots** - Direction beats position
- **Regular review prevents drift** - Small adjustments now vs. major corrections later
- **Celebration builds momentum** - Acknowledge progress, not just problems

**The money date**: Treat financial review as a recurring appointment. Same time, same place, consistent ritual. Pair with something enjoyable (coffee, wine, favorite music).

## Common Pitfalls

- **Skipping when things are "fine"**: That's exactly when reviews are easiest and most valuable. Build the habit when it's easy.

- **Only reviewing when stressed**: Reactive reviews are emotional. Proactive reviews are strategic.

- **Focusing only on problems**: Celebrate wins. Increased savings rate by 2%? That's huge over time. Acknowledge it.

- **Not tracking over time**: A single snapshot is useless. The trend line tells the real story.

- **Analysis paralysis**: Review is for awareness and action, not perfection. 30 minutes of imperfect review beats 0 minutes of postponed perfection.

- **Ignoring retirement accounts**: Out of sight, out of mind. Include them in every review even if you're not touching them.

## Examples

**Example 1: Monthly review finding**

**Situation**: Monthly review reveals dining out category 40% over budget

**Discovery**: Three "quick lunches" that weren't tracked added up

**Action**: Set up meal prep on Sundays, pack lunch 4 days/week

**Result**: Next month, dining out on budget, $200 redirected to savings

---

**Example 2: Quarterly investment check**

**Situation**: Quarterly review shows portfolio drifted to 80% stocks (target: 70%)

**Action**: Rebalance by directing new contributions to bonds for 3 months

**Result**: Back to target allocation without selling (avoiding taxes)

---

**Example 3: Annual review revelation**

**Situation**: Annual review shows 12 subscriptions totaling $487/month

**Discovery**: 4 subscriptions ($127/month) unused in past 6 months

**Action**: Cancel unused subscriptions, negotiate 2 others

**Result**: $150/month saved = $1,800/year redirected to investment

---

**Example 4: Net worth tracking motivation**

**Situation**: Starting net worth: -$45,000 (student loans)

**Monthly tracking**:
- Month 1: -$45,000
- Month 6: -$38,000
- Month 12: -$28,000
- Month 24: -$5,000
- Month 30: +$8,000

**Insight**: Watching the trend line move from negative to positive provided motivation during the hard months. Each review showed progress even when the number was still negative.

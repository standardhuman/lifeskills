# Project Planning

## Overview

Write comprehensive action plans assuming the executor has zero context and limited time. Document everything needed: specific actions, resources required, how to verify progress. Give the whole plan as bite-sized tasks.

**Principles:** Don't repeat yourself. Don't over-build. Frequent checkpoints.

## Before Starting (Optional)

If you're feeling unclear or have mixed feelings:
- **Feeling stuck?** → Try self-connection first
- **Unsure of direction?** → Try design-exploration first
- **Ready to plan?** → Continue below

## Bite-Sized Task Granularity

**Each step is one action (5-15 minutes):**
- "Research X" - step
- "Draft the email" - step
- "Send the email" - step
- "Schedule the meeting" - step
- "Review and reflect" - step

**NOT:** "Handle the email situation" (too vague, too big)

## Plan Structure

### Header

Every plan starts with:

```markdown
# [Project Name] Action Plan

**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this accomplishes]

**Approach:** [2-3 sentences about how we'll get there]

**Timeline:** [Rough timeframe if relevant]

**Success Criteria:** [How we know it's done]

---
```

### Task Structure

```markdown
### Task N: [Component Name]

**Resources needed:**
- [Tools, people, information required]

**Step 1: [Specific action]**
- Details of what to do
- Expected outcome

**Step 2: [Next action]**
- Details of what to do
- Expected outcome

**Checkpoint:** [How to verify this task is complete]
```

## Key Principles

### Be Specific
- "Email John about the proposal" not "Handle communications"
- "Research three competitors' pricing" not "Do market research"
- "Call Mom on Sunday at 10am" not "Stay in touch with family"

### Include Everything Needed
- What resources or information are required?
- Who needs to be involved?
- What decisions need to be made?
- What could block progress?

### Assume Zero Context
- Someone picking this up cold should understand it
- Don't assume knowledge of background
- Spell out acronyms, explain references

### Build in Checkpoints
- After each task: How do we know it's done?
- Natural pause points for reflection
- Opportunities to course-correct

### Don't Over-Plan
- Plan for the current reality, not hypotheticals
- Leave room for learning and adjustment
- Simple is better than comprehensive
- You can always add more detail later

## Applicable Domains

This skill works for:
- **Business:** Launches, campaigns, hiring processes
- **Financial:** Debt payoff, major purchases, tax preparation
- **Health:** Fitness programs, habit changes, medical journeys
- **Personal:** Moving, events, relationship initiatives
- **Learning:** Skill development, certifications, projects

## Example Task Breakdown

```markdown
### Task 1: Clarify the Situation

**Step 1: Gather current information**
- List what you know
- Identify what you don't know

**Step 2: Identify key stakeholders**
- Who is affected?
- Who needs to be involved?

**Checkpoint:** You can clearly explain the situation to someone else.

### Task 2: Define Options

**Step 1: Brainstorm possible approaches**
- Generate at least 3 options
- Don't filter yet

**Step 2: Evaluate each option**
- Pros and cons
- Effort vs. impact

**Checkpoint:** You have 2-3 viable options with trade-offs understood.
```

## Execution Handoff

After completing the plan, offer execution choice:

**"Plan complete. Two execution options:**

**1. Work through now** - Execute tasks one by one, checking off as we go

**2. Save for later** - Document the plan for future reference

**Which approach?"**

If working through now → Use plan-execution skill

## Skill Chaining

After completing project-planning:
- **If ready to execute** → plan-execution
- **If need to choose between approaches** → decision-making
- **If plan revealed emotional blocks** → self-connection

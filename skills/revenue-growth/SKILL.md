# Revenue Growth

## Overview

Framework for systematically growing business revenue through the five fundamental growth levers. Revenue growth isn't magic - it's math. Understanding the levers and focusing on highest-impact improvements creates predictable, sustainable growth.

**When to use**: Stagnant revenue, planning growth strategy, identifying opportunities, scaling from current level

## Quick Reference

**The Revenue Growth Formula**:
```
Revenue = Leads × Conversion Rate × Average Value × Purchase Frequency × Retention
```

**The Five Growth Levers**:
| Lever | Definition | Example 10% Improvement |
|-------|------------|-------------------------|
| Leads | People who might buy | 100 → 110 leads |
| Conversion | % who become customers | 20% → 22% |
| Value | Average transaction size | $500 → $550 |
| Frequency | How often they buy | 2x/year → 2.2x/year |
| Retention | How long they stay | 3 years → 3.3 years |

**Compound effect**: 10% improvement in each lever = 61% revenue increase

## Growth Planning Process

### Step 1: Know Your Numbers

**Current state analysis**:

| Metric | Current | Industry Benchmark |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| Leads/month | ? | ? |
| Conversion rate | ? | ? |
| Average value | ? | ? |
| Purchase frequency | ? | ? |
| Retention rate | ? | ? |

**Calculate current revenue**:
Leads × Conversion × Value × Frequency × Retention = Revenue

### Step 2: Identify Leverage Points

**Where's the biggest opportunity?**:
- Which metric is furthest below benchmark?
- Which is easiest to improve?
- Which has highest impact?

**Prioritization matrix**:

| Lever | Potential Impact | Ease | Priority |
|-------|-----------------|------|----------|
| Leads | High/Med/Low | H/M/L | 1-5 |
| Conversion | H/M/L | H/M/L | 1-5 |
| Value | H/M/L | H/M/L | 1-5 |
| Frequency | H/M/L | H/M/L | 1-5 |
| Retention | H/M/L | H/M/L | 1-5 |

### Step 3: Create Action Plan

**For top 1-2 priorities**:
1. What specific actions will improve this lever?
2. What resources are needed?
3. Who owns this initiative?
4. What's the target improvement?
5. How will we measure progress?

### Step 4: Execute and Measure

**Track weekly**:
- Leading indicators (activities)
- Lagging indicators (results)
- Adjust tactics based on data

## Key Principles

**Why it works**:
- **Math-based**: Clear metrics, measurable progress
- **Compound effect**: Small improvements multiply
- **Focus beats scatter**: Better to move one lever 30% than all levers 5%
- **Systematic**: Repeatable process, not random tactics

**Growth principles**:
1. **Measure first**: Can't improve what you don't measure
2. **Focus**: Pick one or two levers per quarter
3. **Test**: Try multiple tactics, double down on winners
4. **Patience**: Real growth takes quarters, not weeks
5. **Sustainability**: Growth that kills quality isn't growth

## Common Pitfalls

- **Focusing only on new leads**: Acquisition is expensive. Retention and upsell are often higher ROI.

- **Not knowing your numbers**: Guessing isn't a strategy. Track the metrics.

- **Improving everything at once**: Focus dilutes results. Pick one lever.

- **Ignoring retention**: A leaky bucket never fills. Fix churn before pouring in more leads.

- **Short-term thinking**: Sustainable growth takes time. Don't sacrifice quality for quick wins.

- **Copying competitors**: What works for them may not work for you. Test your own approaches.

## Examples

**Example 1: Small service business 50% growth**

**Starting point**:
- Leads: 50/month
- Conversion: 20%
- Value: $2,000
- Frequency: 1.5x/year
- Revenue: $30K/month

**Focus**: Conversion rate (easiest to improve)

**Actions**:
- Improved proposal template
- Added case studies
- Faster follow-up (same day)
- Created FAQ doc for common objections

**Result**: Conversion 20% → 30%
**New revenue**: $45K/month (50% increase)
**Same leads, higher conversion**

**Example 2: E-commerce compound growth**

**Starting point**: $100K/month revenue

**Improvements over 6 months**:
- Traffic: +15% (SEO + paid ads)
- Conversion: +10% (better product pages)
- AOV: +12% (bundle offers)
- Frequency: +8% (email marketing)
- Retention: +5% (loyalty program)

**Compound effect**: 1.15 × 1.10 × 1.12 × 1.08 × 1.05 = 1.61

**New revenue**: $161K/month (61% increase)

**Example 3: B2B SaaS reducing churn**

**Problem**: 5% monthly churn killing growth

**Focus**: Retention (the biggest leak)

**Actions**:
- Improved onboarding (first 14 days)
- Customer success check-ins
- At-risk customer alerts
- Win-back campaign for recent churns

**Result**: Churn 5% → 2.5%

**Impact**:
- Before: 100 customers - 5 churn + 6 new = 101 (net 1)
- After: 100 customers - 2.5 churn + 6 new = 103.5 (net 3.5)
- 3.5x faster growth rate, same acquisition effort

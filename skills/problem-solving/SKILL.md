# Systematic Problem-Solving

## Overview

Random fixes waste time and create new problems. Quick patches mask underlying issues.

**Core principle:** ALWAYS find root cause before attempting fixes. Treating symptoms is failure.

This applies to business problems, health issues, relationship conflicts, financial struggles, and any situation where something "isn't working."

## Before Starting (Optional)

If you're feeling unclear or have mixed feelings:
- **Feeling frustrated or overwhelmed?** → Try self-connection first
- **Not sure what the problem even is?** → Try design-exploration first
- **Ready to investigate?** → Continue below

## The Iron Law

```
NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST
```

If you haven't completed Phase 1, you cannot propose solutions.

## When to Use

Use for ANY persistent issue:
- Business problems (revenue declining, customers churning)
- Health issues (persistent symptoms, energy problems)
- Relationship conflicts (recurring arguments, communication breakdowns)
- Financial struggles (money disappearing, can't save)
- Project failures (missed deadlines, poor outcomes)
- Habit failures (can't stick to routines)

**Use this ESPECIALLY when:**
- Under time pressure (emergencies make guessing tempting)
- "Just one quick fix" seems obvious
- You've already tried multiple solutions
- Previous fix didn't work
- You don't fully understand the issue

## The Four Phases

Complete each phase before proceeding to the next.

### Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

**BEFORE attempting ANY solution:**

1. **Describe the Problem Clearly**
   - What exactly is happening?
   - What should be happening instead?
   - How do you know it's a problem?
   - Quantify if possible (how much, how often)

2. **Reproduce Consistently**
   - Does it happen every time?
   - What are the exact conditions?
   - When did it start?
   - If intermittent → gather more data, don't guess

3. **Check Recent Changes**
   - What changed around the time it started?
   - New circumstances, people, habits, environment?
   - What's different from when it worked?

4. **Gather Evidence**
   - Talk to people involved
   - Look at data/records
   - Document patterns
   - Don't assume - verify

5. **Trace the Flow**
   - Where does the problem originate?
   - What leads to the symptom?
   - Keep tracing backward until you find the source
   - Fix at source, not at symptom

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

**Find the pattern before fixing:**

1. **Find Working Examples**
   - When did this work well?
   - What's similar that works?
   - What do successful cases have in common?

2. **Compare Against References**
   - How do others solve this?
   - What does research/expertise suggest?
   - What's the established approach?

3. **Identify Differences**
   - What's different between working and broken?
   - List every difference, however small
   - Don't assume "that can't matter"

### Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing

**Scientific method:**

1. **Form Single Hypothesis**
   - State clearly: "I think X is the root cause because Y"
   - Write it down
   - Be specific, not vague

2. **Test Minimally**
   - Make the SMALLEST possible change to test hypothesis
   - One variable at a time
   - Don't fix multiple things at once

3. **Verify Before Continuing**
   - Did it work? Yes → Phase 4
   - Didn't work? Form NEW hypothesis
   - DON'T add more fixes on top

4. **When You Don't Know**
   - Say "I don't understand X"
   - Don't pretend to know
   - Ask for help or research more

### Phase 4: Implementation

**Fix the root cause, not the symptom:**

1. **Define Success Criteria**
   - How will you know it's fixed?
   - What measurement proves improvement?
   - Set specific, measurable targets

2. **Implement Single Solution**
   - Address the root cause identified
   - ONE change at a time
   - No "while I'm here" additions

3. **Verify Solution**
   - Did it actually work?
   - Measure against success criteria
   - Give it enough time to prove out

4. **If Solution Doesn't Work**
   - STOP
   - Count: How many solutions have you tried?
   - If < 3: Return to Phase 1, re-analyze
   - If ≥ 3: The problem may be structural

5. **If 3+ Solutions Failed: Question Structure**
   - Is this fundamentally solvable in current form?
   - Are you treating symptoms of a bigger issue?
   - Should you restructure rather than fix?
   - Get outside perspective before trying again

## Red Flags - STOP and Follow Process

If you catch yourself thinking:
- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "It's probably X, let me fix that"
- "I don't fully understand but this might work"
- Proposing solutions before understanding the problem
- "One more attempt" (when already tried 2+)

**ALL of these mean: STOP. Return to Phase 1.**

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Issue is simple, don't need process" | Simple issues have root causes too |
| "Emergency, no time for process" | Systematic is FASTER than thrashing |
| "Just try this first, then investigate" | First fix sets the pattern. Do it right. |
| "I see the problem, let me fix it" | Seeing symptoms ≠ understanding root cause |
| "One more attempt" (after failures) | Multiple failures = wrong diagnosis |

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Key Activities | Success Criteria |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **1. Root Cause** | Describe, reproduce, check changes, gather evidence | Understand WHAT and WHY |
| **2. Pattern** | Find working examples, compare | Identify key differences |
| **3. Hypothesis** | Form theory, test minimally | Confirmed or new hypothesis |
| **4. Implementation** | Define success, implement, verify | Problem resolved, verified |

## Skill Chaining

After completing problem-solving:
- **If need to plan the solution** → project-planning
- **If solution involves choosing between options** → decision-making
- **If discovered it's an emotional issue** → self-connection

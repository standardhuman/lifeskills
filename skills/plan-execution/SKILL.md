# Plan Execution

## Overview

Load plan, review critically, execute tasks in batches, check in between batches.

**Core principle:** Batch execution with checkpoints for reflection and course-correction.

## Before Starting (Optional)

If you're feeling unclear or have mixed feelings:
- **Feeling stuck?** → Try self-connection first
- **Unsure about the plan?** → Review with design-exploration first
- **Ready to execute?** → Continue below

## The Process

### Step 1: Load and Review Plan

1. Read or recall the plan
2. Review critically - identify any questions or concerns
3. If concerns: Address them before starting
4. If no concerns: Proceed to execution

**Questions to ask:**
- Is this still the right approach?
- Has anything changed since planning?
- Are all the steps still clear?
- Do I have what I need to start?

### Step 2: Execute Batch

**Default: 3-5 tasks at a time**

For each task:
1. Mark as "in progress"
2. Follow each step as written
3. Complete the verification/checkpoint
4. Mark as "completed"

**Track progress:**
- What's done
- What's in progress
- What's remaining

### Step 3: Check In

When batch complete:
- Summarize what was accomplished
- Note any obstacles or surprises
- Reflect: Is the plan still on track?
- Ask: "Ready for next batch, or need to adjust?"

### Step 4: Continue or Adjust

Based on the check-in:
- If on track: Execute next batch
- If adjustments needed: Update plan, then continue
- Repeat until complete

### Step 5: Verify Completion

After all tasks complete:
- Review original goals
- Confirm success criteria met
- Celebrate or note lessons learned

## When to Stop and Reflect

**STOP executing immediately when:**
- Hit a blocker (missing information, can't proceed)
- Something feels wrong
- Plan has gaps preventing progress
- You don't understand what to do next
- Energy or motivation drops significantly

**Reflect rather than forcing through.**

## When to Revisit the Plan

**Return to planning when:**
- Circumstances have changed significantly
- Multiple tasks are blocked
- The approach isn't working
- New information changes the situation

**Don't force through blockers** - stop and reassess.

## Batch Size Guidelines

| Situation | Batch Size |
|-----------|------------|
| Complex/unfamiliar tasks | 1-2 tasks |
| Standard tasks | 3-5 tasks |
| Simple/routine tasks | 5-7 tasks |
| Low energy/motivation | 1-2 tasks |

Adjust based on how you're feeling and task complexity.

## Progress Tracking

Simple format:
```
[x] Task 1: Description (completed)
[>] Task 2: Description (in progress)
[ ] Task 3: Description (pending)
[ ] Task 4: Description (pending)
```

## Key Principles

- **Review plan critically first** - Don't blindly execute outdated plans
- **Follow plan steps as written** - If they need changing, change the plan first
- **Don't skip checkpoints** - They exist for a reason
- **Between batches: just check in and wait** - Don't rush ahead
- **Stop when blocked, don't guess** - Blockers are information

## Skill Chaining

After completing plan-execution:
- **If need to verify results** → verification
- **If problems arose during execution** → problem-solving
- **If feeling drained** → self-connection

# Business Planning

## Overview

Framework for setting business direction, goals, and execution plans. Transforms vague ambitions into concrete actions with measurable milestones. Regular planning creates clarity, alignment, and accountability. The goal: know where you're going and how you'll get there.

**When to use**: Annual planning, quarterly reviews, starting a new business, pivoting strategy, feeling directionless

## Quick Reference

| Planning Type | Frequency | Time Horizon | Focus |
|--------------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Vision/Mission | Annual+ | 3-10 years | Direction |
| Annual Plan | Yearly | 12 months | Major goals |
| Quarterly Plan | Quarterly | 90 days | Key priorities |
| Weekly Plan | Weekly | 7 days | Execution |

## The Planning Framework

### Level 1: Vision & Mission (Annual Review)

**Vision**: Where are you going? (Future state)
**Mission**: Why do you exist? (Purpose)
**Values**: How do you operate? (Principles)

**Vision questions**:
- What does success look like in 3-5 years?
- What impact do you want to have?
- What would make you proud?

**Mission questions**:
- Who do you serve?
- What problem do you solve?
- What makes you different?

**Keep it simple**: One sentence each. If you can't remember it, it's too complex.

**AskUserQuestion**: "What's your vision for this business in 3-5 years?"

### Level 2: Annual Planning

Set major goals for the year.

**Annual planning process**:

```
□ Review last year (what worked, what didn't)
□ Define 3-5 major annual goals
□ Identify key metrics for each goal
□ Determine quarterly milestones
□ Identify major initiatives/projects
□ Allocate resources (time, money, people)
□ Identify risks and mitigation
```

**Goal-setting framework (SMART)**:
- **S**pecific: What exactly will you accomplish?
- **M**easurable: How will you know you succeeded?
- **A**chievable: Is it realistic?
- **R**elevant: Does it serve your vision?
- **T**ime-bound: By when?

**Example annual goal**:
- Vague: "Grow the business"
- SMART: "Increase revenue from $200K to $300K (50% growth) by December 31, 2024, primarily through launching two new service offerings and increasing average client value by 25%"

**Key metrics to track** (pick relevant ones):
- Revenue
- Profit/margins
- Customer count
- Customer retention
- Average transaction value
- Lead conversion rate
- Customer satisfaction
- Key product/service metrics

**AskUserQuestion**: "What are the 3-5 most important things your business needs to accomplish this year?"

### Level 3: Quarterly Planning (90-Day Sprints)

Break annual goals into quarterly priorities.

**Why 90 days**:
- Long enough for meaningful progress
- Short enough to maintain urgency
- Allows for course correction
- Visible finish line maintains motivation

**Quarterly planning process**:

```
□ Review previous quarter (results vs. goals)
□ Assess current position (metrics, market, resources)
□ Select 1-3 quarterly priorities (rocks)
□ Define success criteria for each priority
□ Break into monthly milestones
□ Identify who owns what
□ Schedule quarterly review
```

**Quarterly priorities (Rocks)**:
- 1-3 major initiatives that, if completed, make the quarter successful
- Not everything you'll do - the critical few
- Each rock has clear owner and success criteria

**Monthly milestones**:
For each rock, define what "done" looks like at end of Month 1, 2, 3.

| Rock | Month 1 | Month 2 | Month 3 |
|------|---------|---------|---------|
| Rock 1 | Milestone... | Milestone... | Complete |
| Rock 2 | Milestone... | Milestone... | Complete |

**AskUserQuestion**: "Looking at your annual goals, what 1-3 things must happen this quarter to stay on track?"

### Level 4: Weekly Execution

Connect daily work to quarterly priorities.

**Weekly planning rhythm**:
1. Review quarterly priorities and monthly milestones
2. Identify 3-5 weekly priorities that advance rocks
3. Schedule time blocks for priority work
4. Protect priority time from distractions

**Weekly review questions**:
- What did I accomplish toward my rocks?
- What blocked progress?
- What are the top 3 priorities for next week?
- Is anything off track that needs addressing?

**Daily prioritization**:
- #1 priority: Advances quarterly rock
- #2-3: Important but not rock-related
- Everything else: If time permits

## Business Model Canvas (Quick Version)

For new businesses or strategic pivots:

| Element | Question |
|---------|----------|
| Customer Segments | Who are you serving? |
| Value Proposition | What problem do you solve? |
| Channels | How do you reach customers? |
| Customer Relationships | How do you interact? |
| Revenue Streams | How do you make money? |
| Key Resources | What do you need to deliver? |
| Key Activities | What must you do well? |
| Key Partners | Who helps you deliver? |
| Cost Structure | What are your main costs? |

## Key Principles

**Why it works**:
- **Clarity**: Written plans force clear thinking
- **Focus**: Saying yes to priorities means saying no to distractions
- **Accountability**: Measurable goals enable honest assessment
- **Alignment**: Everyone knows what matters
- **Momentum**: Regular rhythm builds progress

**Planning principles**:
1. **Start with the end**: Work backward from desired outcome
2. **Focus beats breadth**: Few priorities, well-executed
3. **Measure what matters**: What gets measured gets managed
4. **Review regularly**: Plans without reviews are wishes
5. **Adapt quickly**: Change course when data says to

**The planning fallacy**: We overestimate what we can do in a week, underestimate what we can do in a year. Plan conservatively for short-term, ambitiously for long-term.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Too many priorities**: If everything is a priority, nothing is. Choose 1-3 per quarter.

- **Planning without review**: Plans that aren't reviewed become irrelevant. Schedule reviews.

- **All strategy, no tactics**: Vision without weekly actions is dreaming. Connect daily work to goals.

- **Perfectionism paralysis**: Done plan > perfect plan. Start with rough plan, refine as you learn.

- **Planning in isolation**: If others are involved, involve them in planning. Top-down plans lack buy-in.

- **Set and forget**: Annual plans need quarterly adjustment. Markets change, learn, adapt.

- **Vanity metrics**: Revenue without profit, followers without customers. Track metrics that matter.

# Client Management

## Overview

Framework for building and maintaining successful client relationships from first contact through long-term retention. Great client relationships are built on clear communication, managed expectations, and consistent value delivery. The goal: clients who stay, pay, and refer.

**When to use**: Onboarding new clients, improving client communication, handling difficult situations, reducing churn, building referral relationships

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Focus | Key Actions |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Onboarding | Set expectations | Welcome, scope, communication plan |
| Active | Deliver value | Regular updates, proactive communication |
| Maintenance | Retain & grow | Check-ins, upsells, referral requests |
| Offboarding | End well | Transition, feedback, door open |

## Client Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Onboarding

First 30 days set the tone for the entire relationship.

**Onboarding checklist**:
```
□ Send welcome email/packet within 24 hours
□ Schedule kickoff call
□ Document scope and deliverables
□ Establish communication preferences
□ Set expectations for timeline and process
□ Introduce team members they'll work with
□ Provide access to necessary tools/portals
□ Schedule first check-in
```

**Welcome communication should include**:
- Excitement about working together
- Summary of what you'll deliver
- Timeline and key milestones
- How and when you'll communicate
- What you need from them
- Who to contact for what

**Kickoff call agenda**:
1. Build rapport (5 min)
2. Review goals and success metrics (15 min)
3. Confirm scope and deliverables (10 min)
4. Agree on communication rhythm (5 min)
5. Immediate next steps (5 min)
6. Questions (10 min)

**AskUserQuestion**: "What does your current client onboarding look like? What often goes wrong in early client relationships?"

### Phase 2: Active Engagement

Consistent communication and value delivery.

**Communication rhythm**:

| Frequency | Type | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| As needed | Quick updates | Keep informed, no surprises |
| Weekly | Status update | Progress, blockers, next steps |
| Monthly | Review call | Results, feedback, alignment |
| Quarterly | Strategy review | Big picture, goals, expansion |

**Weekly status update template**:
```
Subject: [Project] Weekly Update - [Date]

COMPLETED THIS WEEK:
- Item 1
- Item 2

IN PROGRESS:
- Item 1 (X% complete)
- Item 2 (on track for [date])

BLOCKERS/NEEDS:
- Need [X] from you by [date]

NEXT WEEK:
- Planned item 1
- Planned item 2

Quick note: [Personal touch, insight, or question]
```

**Proactive communication principles**:
- **No surprises**: Tell them about problems before they ask
- **Update before they ask**: If they're wondering, you're too slow
- **Over-communicate early**: Better to over-share in first 90 days
- **Respond within 24 hours**: Even if just to acknowledge

**Managing scope creep**:
When requests exceed agreed scope:
1. Acknowledge the request
2. Explain it's outside current scope
3. Offer options: Add to scope (with cost/time), defer to next phase, or decline
4. Document any changes

**Script**: "Great idea! That's outside our current scope, but we could add it for [additional cost/time], or we could include it in our next phase. What would you prefer?"

### Phase 3: Retention & Growth

Keep clients happy and expand relationships.

**Retention drivers**:
1. **Results**: Are you delivering promised outcomes?
2. **Relationship**: Do they like working with you?
3. **Communication**: Do they feel informed and heard?
4. **Value perception**: Do they see ROI?

**Monthly/quarterly check-in questions**:
- "How are we doing? What's working well?"
- "What could we do better?"
- "Are we still aligned on priorities?"
- "What's coming up for your business that we should know about?"

**Signs of at-risk client**:
- Slower response times
- Shorter communications
- Skipping scheduled calls
- Complaints increasing
- Comparing to competitors
- Payment delays

**At-risk intervention**:
1. Request honest feedback call
2. Listen fully without defending
3. Acknowledge concerns
4. Propose specific solutions
5. Follow up with action

**Growing accounts**:
- Look for additional needs you can serve
- Share relevant ideas proactively
- Introduce complementary services
- Ask: "What other challenges are you facing?"

**Referral requests**:
- Ask after delivering strong results
- Be specific: "Who else in your network faces [problem we solved]?"
- Make it easy: Provide email template, intro language
- Show appreciation: Thank you note, small gift

### Phase 4: Offboarding

End relationships professionally.

**When you end it**:
- Give appropriate notice (30-90 days)
- Explain reason professionally (you can be honest without being harsh)
- Complete current commitments
- Provide transition support
- Leave door open for future

**When they end it**:
- Stay professional (don't take it personally)
- Ask for feedback
- Complete transition gracefully
- Request testimonial if relationship was positive
- Keep in touch (they may return)

**Offboarding checklist**:
```
□ Final deliverables completed
□ Documentation/files transferred
□ Access/passwords updated
□ Final invoice sent
□ Feedback requested
□ Thank you sent
□ Follow-up scheduled (6 months)
```

## Handling Difficult Situations

### Unhappy Client

**The HEARD framework**:
- **H**ear them out fully (don't interrupt)
- **E**mpathize with their frustration
- **A**pologize for the experience (not necessarily fault)
- **R**esolve with specific actions
- **D**ocument and follow up

**Script**: "I hear that you're frustrated with [issue], and I understand why. I'm sorry you've had this experience. Here's what I'm going to do to fix it: [specific actions]. I'll follow up with you on [date] to confirm it's resolved."

### Scope Creep

**Prevention**:
- Document scope clearly at start
- Change order process for additions
- Regular scope reviews

**Response**:
"I want to make sure we deliver on what we promised. This request is outside our current scope. I can add it for [cost/time], include it in a future phase, or we can keep our current focus. What works best for you?"

### Late Payment

**Escalation sequence**:
1. Day 1 overdue: Friendly reminder email
2. Day 7: Phone call to check in
3. Day 14: Formal notice, pause work
4. Day 30: Final notice, collections warning
5. Day 45+: Collections or write off

**Prevention**:
- Clear payment terms upfront
- Deposits on large projects
- Automatic billing when possible
- Invoice immediately upon delivery

### Unrealistic Expectations

**Address early**:
"I want to make sure we're aligned on what's realistic. Based on [factors], here's what we can achieve by [date]. If that doesn't meet your needs, let's discuss alternatives."

**Document everything**: Email confirmations of scope, timeline, deliverables.

## Key Principles

**Why it works**:
- **Expectations management**: Clear expectations = satisfied clients
- **Proactive communication**: Prevents problems before they happen
- **Relationship investment**: Retention is cheaper than acquisition
- **Professional boundaries**: Respect protects both parties

**The client experience formula**:
Satisfaction = Results - Expectations

Exceed expectations by:
1. Under-promise, over-deliver on timeline
2. Add unexpected value
3. Be easier to work with than expected
4. Communicate better than expected

## Common Pitfalls

- **Over-promising to win the deal**: Sets you up for failure. Promise what you can deliver, then exceed it.

- **Not setting boundaries**: 24/7 availability isn't sustainable. Set communication hours and response expectations.

- **Avoiding difficult conversations**: Small issues become big issues. Address concerns early.

- **Assuming they know**: They don't know the progress you're making, the problems you're solving, the value you're adding. Tell them.

- **Taking bad clients**: Some clients aren't worth it at any price. Recognize red flags and say no.

**Client red flags**:
- Disrespects your time repeatedly
- Haggles aggressively on price
- Bad-mouths previous vendors
- Unrealistic expectations despite education
- Scope creep without acknowledging it

## Examples

**Example 1: Successful onboarding**

**Situation**: New consulting client signed $15K engagement

**Onboarding sequence**:
- Day 0: Personal congratulations call (5 min)
- Day 1: Welcome email with timeline, first steps, scheduling link
- Day 3: Kickoff call (45 min)
- Day 5: First status update
- Day 7: Check-in email ("How's it going so far?")
- Day 14: First deliverable + call
- Day 30: First monthly review

**Result**: Client feels valued, informed, and confident. Sets tone for entire engagement.

**Example 2: Turning around unhappy client**

**Situation**: Client frustrated with delayed deliverable

**Bad response**: "We've been really busy and your project is complex."

**Good response**: "I hear that you're frustrated with the delay, and you're right to be. I should have communicated earlier. Here's what happened: [brief explanation]. Here's what I'm doing to fix it: [specific actions]. I'll have [deliverable] to you by [date], and I'll send you daily updates until then. Is there anything else I can do to make this right?"

**Result**: Client feels heard, sees accountability, knows what to expect. Often becomes stronger relationship.

**Example 3: Growing an account**

**Situation**: Client happy with current service, potential for more

**Approach**:
- During quarterly review: "Your [metric] has improved by [X]. What other areas of your business could use that kind of improvement?"
- Client mentions challenge in different area
- "That's actually something we help clients with. Want me to show you what we've done for others in that situation?"

**Result**: Expanded from $3K/month to $7K/month engagement. Client consolidates with trusted partner rather than finding new vendor.

# Debt Payoff

## Overview

Strategic approach to eliminate debt systematically, reduce interest paid, and build momentum toward debt freedom. Transforms overwhelming debt into a manageable plan with clear milestones. The psychological win of paying off debts creates motivation that pure math can't.

**When to use**: Multiple debts to manage, feeling overwhelmed by debt, wanting to accelerate debt payoff, deciding between debt payoff strategies

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Action | Time |
|-------|--------|------|
| 1. Inventory | List all debts | 10 min |
| 2. Strategy | Choose payoff method | 10 min |
| 3. Plan | Create payment schedule | 15 min |
| 4. Accelerate | Find extra money | 15 min |
| 5. Execute | Implement and track | Ongoing |

**Total time**: 45-60 minutes to create plan

## The Process

Copy this checklist using TodoWrite to track progress:

```
□ Phase 1: Inventory all debts
□ Phase 2: Choose strategy (avalanche or snowball)
□ Phase 3: Create payment schedule
□ Phase 4: Find acceleration money
□ Phase 5: Set up tracking system
```

### Phase 1: Inventory (10 minutes)

List every debt completely.

**For each debt, record**:
- Creditor name
- Current balance
- Interest rate (APR)
- Minimum payment
- Due date

**Debt inventory table**:

| Debt | Balance | APR | Min Payment | Due Date |
|------|---------|-----|-------------|----------|
| Credit Card A | $5,000 | 22% | $150 | 15th |
| Car Loan | $12,000 | 6% | $350 | 1st |
| Student Loan | $25,000 | 5% | $280 | 20th |

**Don't forget**:
- All credit cards
- Personal loans
- Car loans
- Student loans
- Medical debt
- Money owed to family
- Buy-now-pay-later balances

**AskUserQuestion**: "Let's list all your debts. What do you owe, to whom, and at what interest rate?"

### Phase 2: Strategy (10 minutes)

Choose your payoff method.

**Option A: Debt Avalanche (Mathematically Optimal)**
- Pay minimums on all debts
- Put extra money toward highest interest rate first
- When that's paid, roll payment to next highest rate
- **Pros**: Pays least interest overall
- **Cons**: Might take longer to see first win

**Option B: Debt Snowball (Psychologically Optimal)**
- Pay minimums on all debts
- Put extra money toward smallest balance first
- When that's paid, roll payment to next smallest
- **Pros**: Quick wins build momentum
- **Cons**: May pay more interest overall

**Which to choose**:
- If you need motivation and quick wins: **Snowball**
- If you're disciplined and want to minimize interest: **Avalanche**
- If highest rate debt is also smallest: **Either** (you get both benefits)

**The hybrid approach**: If you have a very high interest debt (>20%), pay that first regardless of size, then switch to snowball.

**AskUserQuestion**: "Looking at your debts, which strategy appeals to you - avalanche (highest interest first) or snowball (smallest balance first)?"

### Phase 3: Plan (15 minutes)

Create your payment schedule.

**Step 1**: Calculate total minimum payments
**Step 2**: Determine extra money available for debt
**Step 3**: Apply extra to target debt
**Step 4**: Project payoff timeline

**Example snowball plan**:

| Month | CC A ($5K) | Car ($12K) | Student ($25K) | Total Paid |
|-------|------------|------------|----------------|------------|
| 1 | $350 | $350 | $280 | $980 |
| 2 | $350 | $350 | $280 | $980 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 15 | $0 (PAID) | $550 | $280 | $830 |

**Key insight**: When CC A is paid off, that $350 rolls to the car loan, accelerating payoff.

**Payoff calculator**: Use online debt payoff calculators to project timelines

**AskUserQuestion**: "How much extra can you put toward debt each month beyond minimums?"

### Phase 4: Accelerate (15 minutes)

Find extra money to speed up payoff.

**Income side**:
- Sell unused items
- Pick up overtime or side work
- Negotiate raise
- Tax refund → debt
- Bonuses → debt
- Cash gifts → debt

**Expense side**:
- Pause retirement beyond match (controversial but effective)
- Reduce dining out
- Cancel subscriptions
- Lower insurance costs
- Refinance high-interest debt

**The debt emergency mindset**: Treat debt like a crisis. Temporary sacrifice for permanent freedom. This isn't forever, just until you're out.

**Refinancing options**:
- Balance transfer to 0% card (watch fees and expiration)
- Personal loan to consolidate (lower rate than cards)
- Student loan refinancing (careful: may lose federal protections)

**AskUserQuestion**: "What could you cut or earn to add an extra $200-500/month to debt payoff?"

### Phase 5: Execute (Ongoing)

Implement and maintain momentum.

**Setup**:
1. Automate minimum payments (never miss)
2. Schedule extra payment for payday
3. Create visual tracker (chart, thermometer)
4. Set milestone celebrations

**Monthly check-in**:
- Update balances
- Celebrate progress
- Adjust if income/expenses changed
- Stay motivated with debt-free vision

**When you pay off a debt**:
1. Celebrate (small, free celebration)
2. Roll that payment to next debt
3. Update your tracker
4. Feel the momentum

## Key Principles

**Why it works**:
- **Guaranteed return**: Paying off 20% debt = guaranteed 20% return
- **Momentum effect**: Each payoff builds motivation for the next
- **Simplified life**: Fewer payments, less mental load
- **Freedom**: Debt-free opens options unavailable when payments are owed

**The math of debt**:
- $5,000 at 20% with minimum payments = ~10 years and ~$5,000 in interest
- $5,000 at 20% with aggressive payments = ~18 months and ~$900 in interest

**Debt is an emergency**: High-interest debt (>10%) should be treated urgently. It's actively working against you every day.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Paying extra without a plan**: Scattered extra payments feel good but don't accelerate payoff. Focus on one target debt.

- **Closing cards after payoff**: Keep oldest cards open (helps credit score). Just don't use them.

- **Not having an emergency fund**: Without $1,000 emergency fund, any crisis goes on credit cards. Build mini emergency fund first.

- **Lifestyle creep after payoff**: When a debt is paid, the money should roll to next debt, not to new spending.

- **Shame spiral**: Debt shame leads to avoidance. Face it with a plan. You're solving this, not hiding from it.

- **Taking on new debt**: Don't finance anything new while paying off debt. Cash only until you're out.

## Special Situations

### High-Interest Emergency

If you have debt over 20% APR:
1. This is priority #1 (after basic emergency fund)
2. Consider balance transfer to 0% card
3. Look into personal loan at lower rate
4. Throw everything at it - this is bleeding money

### Debt vs. Investing

**General rule**:
- Debt over 7%: Pay off before investing beyond employer match
- Debt under 5%: Invest while making minimum payments
- Debt 5-7%: Personal preference (guaranteed vs. potential return)

**Always**: Get full employer 401k match (100% return)

### Student Loans Specifically

**Federal loans**:
- Check income-driven repayment options
- Public Service Loan Forgiveness if eligible
- Don't refinance federal loans without understanding tradeoffs

**Private loans**:
- Refinancing often makes sense
- Shop multiple lenders
- No special protections to lose

## Examples

**Example 1: Credit card snowball**

**Situation**: 3 credit cards, total $12,000

| Card | Balance | APR | Minimum |
|------|---------|-----|---------|
| Store card | $800 | 25% | $25 |
| Visa | $4,200 | 19% | $100 |
| Mastercard | $7,000 | 17% | $175 |

**Extra available**: $300/month

**Snowball plan**:
- Month 1-3: Store card gets $325 ($25 min + $300 extra) = PAID
- Month 4-14: Visa gets $425 ($100 min + $325 rolled) = PAID
- Month 15-28: Mastercard gets $600 ($175 min + $425 rolled) = PAID

**Timeline**: 28 months to debt-free
**Interest paid**: ~$2,800

**Example 2: Mixed debt avalanche**

**Situation**: Credit card + car loan + student loans

| Debt | Balance | APR | Minimum |
|------|---------|-----|---------|
| Credit card | $6,000 | 22% | $150 |
| Car loan | $15,000 | 5% | $400 |
| Student loans | $30,000 | 6% | $350 |

**Extra available**: $400/month

**Avalanche plan**:
- Months 1-11: Credit card ($550/month) = PAID
- Months 12-40: Student loans ($750/month rolled from CC) = PAID
- Months 41-60: Car loan (paying minimum throughout, then $1,150) = PAID

**Why avalanche here**: 22% credit card rate makes it clear target

**Example 3: Debt emergency response**

**Situation**: $20,000 credit card debt at 24% APR after job loss

**Emergency actions**:
1. Called all creditors to negotiate lower rates (got 2 reduced to 18%)
2. Balance transferred $5,000 to 0% card (18-month promo)
3. Sold items worth $3,000 → paid to highest rate card
4. Cut expenses to bare minimum → $800/month to debt
5. Picked up gig work → additional $600/month to debt

**Result**: $20,000 at 24% → paid off in 16 months instead of 10+ years
**Interest saved**: ~$15,000

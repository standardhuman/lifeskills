# Self-Connection

## Overview

Brief check-in practice to reconnect with your present experience, feelings, and needs. Foundation for authentic decision-making and communication. Takes 3-5 minutes but provides clarity that saves hours of going down wrong paths.

**When to use**: Before important decisions, before difficult conversations, when feeling numb/disconnected, when operating from "should" vs. "want"

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Question | Time |
|-------|----------|------|
| 1. Pause | Stop the doing | 30 sec |
| 2. Body | What do I notice in my body? | 1 min |
| 3. Feeling | What am I feeling? | 1 min |
| 4. Need | What do I need right now? | 1-2 min |
| 5. Respond | What wants to happen? | 1 min |

**Total time**: 3-5 minutes

## The Process

### Phase 1: Pause (30 seconds)

Stop what you're doing. Literally stop.

**Actions**:
1. Stop typing, talking, moving, planning
2. Take 3 slow breaths
3. Arrive in this moment (not past, not future, just now)

**Why pause**: You can't connect with yourself while also doing something else. Self-connection requires stopping the doing.

**If resistance comes up**: Notice it. "I don't have time for this" is information. (You especially need this when you "don't have time.")

### Phase 2: Body (1 minute)

Bring attention to physical sensations.

**Ask yourself**:
- What do I notice in my body right now?
- Where is there tension? Ease? Temperature? Pressure?
- Scan from head to toe: forehead, jaw, shoulders, chest, belly, hands, legs

**Write down or note**:
- "Tension in shoulders"
- "Tight feeling in chest"
- "Fluttery sensation in stomach"
- "Numbness" is also a sensation

**Why body first**: Feelings live in the body. If you try to identify feelings without checking your body first, you'll end up in your head (thinking about feelings vs. feeling them).

**Tool**: AskUserQuestion can guide body scan

### Phase 3: Feeling (1 minute)

Name what you're feeling. Be specific.

**Ask yourself**: "What am I feeling right now?"

**Use specific emotion words**:
- Not "bad" → angry, sad, scared, frustrated, disappointed, overwhelmed
- Not "good" → happy, excited, relieved, proud, peaceful, grateful
- Not "stressed" → anxious, worried, pressured, scattered

**Multiple feelings**: It's normal to feel multiple things at once. Name them all.

**Common trap**: "I feel like they don't care" is a THOUGHT, not a feeling. The feeling underneath might be "hurt" or "angry" or "lonely."

**Feelings wheel**: Use a feelings wheel if you're stuck (Google "feelings wheel")

### Phase 4: Need (1-2 minutes)

Identify the need or value underneath the feeling.

**Ask yourself**: "What do I need right now?" or "What need isn't met that's creating this feeling?"

**Universal human needs** (NVC framework):
- Autonomy: choice, freedom, independence
- Connection: belonging, understanding, intimacy
- Meaning: purpose, contribution, growth
- Peace: beauty, ease, harmony
- Physical well-being: rest, food, safety
- Play: fun, humor, joy

**Example connections**:
- Anger often points to → need for respect, autonomy, or fairness
- Sadness often points to → need for connection, understanding, or grieving
- Anxiety often points to → need for safety, clarity, or preparation
- Frustration often points to → need for progress, competence, or ease

**The question**: "If I had [need], how would I feel?" (If that eases the feeling, you've found the need)

**AskUserQuestion**: Can present need categories and help identify

### Phase 5: Respond (1 minute)

With clarity on feeling and need, ask what wants to happen.

**Ask yourself**:
- "What action (if any) would honor this need?"
- "What's the smallest step toward meeting this need?"
- "What wants to happen here?"

**Possible responses**:
- **Action**: "I need to have that conversation"
- **Self-care**: "I need a 10-minute walk"
- **Boundary**: "I need to say no to this request"
- **Acceptance**: "I need to feel this sadness without fixing it"
- **Rest**: "I need to stop working for today"
- **Nothing**: "Just naming this is enough for now"

**Not all needs require immediate action**: Sometimes identifying the need is enough. The need for "understanding" might be met just by understanding yourself.

## Key Principles

**Source**: Nonviolent Communication (Marshall Rosenberg), Focusing (Eugene Gendlin), Mindfulness traditions

**Why it works**:
- **Body wisdom**: Your body knows before your mind does. Tension, butterflies, heaviness are information
- **Feelings are data**: They tell you about met/unmet needs. Ignoring feelings means missing important data
- **Needs vs. strategies**: The need is what matters (connection, safety, growth). Strategies for meeting needs can vary. Self-connection identifies the need so you can choose the best strategy
- **Present moment**: You can only feel what's happening now. Past/future are thoughts. Self-connection happens in the present

**Core insight**: Most suffering comes from disconnection from ourselves - making decisions from "should" instead of from what we actually need.

## Common Pitfalls

- **"I don't have time"**: This takes 3-5 minutes and often saves hours of going down paths that don't actually meet your needs. When you feel you don't have time, you especially need this.

- **Thinking about feelings vs. feeling them**: "I think I'm anxious" vs. actually feeling the anxious sensation in your chest. Drop from head to body.

- **Judging the feelings**: "I shouldn't feel sad about this" adds a second layer of suffering. Feel what's actually here without the "shouldn't."

- **Trying to fix immediately**: The point is connection first, action second. Let yourself just be with what's here before jumping to solutions.

- **"I don't feel anything"**: Numbness is a protective response. If you're numb, that's information too. Start with "I notice numbness" and be gentle.

- **Confusing needs with strategies**: "I need them to apologize" is a strategy. The need underneath might be "acknowledgment" or "repair." Needs are universal; strategies are specific to situations.

## Examples

**Example 1: Before important decision**

**Situation**: Job offer, needs to decide by Friday, feels "stuck"

**Self-connection process**:
- Pause: Stop researching, stop pro/con lists
- Body: "Tight chest, shallow breathing, clenched jaw"
- Feeling: "Anxious and uncertain"
- Need: "I need clarity about my values. What actually matters to me here?"
- Respond: "I need to write down my core values first, then evaluate the offer against those"

**Outcome**: Made decision aligned with values (turned down offer), felt clear instead of conflicted

**Without self-connection**: Would have made decision from "what looks good on paper" instead of "what I actually need"

**Example 2: Before difficult conversation**

**Situation**: Need to give critical feedback to team member, avoiding the conversation

**Self-connection process**:
- Pause: Stop drafting and re-drafting the email
- Body: "Tension in shoulders, knot in stomach"
- Feeling: "Scared and guilty"
- Need: "I need honesty AND care. I need this to help them grow, not hurt them"
- Respond: "I need to have the conversation in person (not email) with both honesty about the issue and care for them as a person"

**Outcome**: Had the conversation skillfully, team member received it well

**Without self-connection**: Email would have been either too harsh (from anxiety) or too soft (from guilt), neither effective

**Example 3: Chronic "should" doing**

**Situation**: Working on "should do" task for 2 hours, making no progress, feeling exhausted

**Self-connection process**:
- Pause: Stop forcing the work
- Body: "Heavy, sluggish, no energy"
- Feeling: "Resentful and tired"
- Need: "I need autonomy. I need to choose what I work on, not just follow a should-list"
- Respond: "I'm going to work on what I actually have energy for right now, and schedule the should-task for tomorrow morning when I have more capacity"

**Outcome**: Got energized work done, scheduled low-energy task for better time

**Pattern**: "Should" without connection to your actual needs = exhaustion. Choice from needs = energy

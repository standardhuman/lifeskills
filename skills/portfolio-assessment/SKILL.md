# Portfolio Assessment

## Overview

Framework for evaluating investment portfolio health, risk alignment, and performance. Ensures your investments match your goals, timeline, and risk tolerance. Regular assessment prevents drift and keeps you on track. Not about picking winners but about maintaining appropriate allocation.

**When to use**: Annual investment review, market volatility causing concern, life changes affecting risk tolerance, approaching retirement, after major contributions

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Action | Time |
|-------|--------|------|
| 1. Inventory | List all investments | 10 min |
| 2. Allocate | Calculate current allocation | 10 min |
| 3. Assess | Compare to target allocation | 10 min |
| 4. Evaluate | Review performance and fees | 15 min |
| 5. Rebalance | Adjust if needed | 15 min |

**Total time**: 45-60 minutes

## The Process

Copy this checklist using TodoWrite to track progress:

```
□ Phase 1: List all investment accounts
□ Phase 2: Calculate current allocation
□ Phase 3: Define/review target allocation
□ Phase 4: Evaluate performance and costs
□ Phase 5: Rebalance if needed
```

### Phase 1: Inventory (10 minutes)

List all investment accounts and holdings.

**Account types to include**:
- 401(k) / 403(b)
- Traditional IRA
- Roth IRA
- Taxable brokerage
- HSA (invested portion)
- Other investment accounts

**For each account, note**:
- Account name and type
- Current balance
- Holdings (funds, stocks, bonds)
- Each holding's value and percentage

**AskUserQuestion**: "What investment accounts do you have? Let's list them all."

### Phase 2: Current Allocation (10 minutes)

Calculate your overall asset allocation.

**Asset classes**:
- **US Stocks**: Large cap, mid cap, small cap
- **International Stocks**: Developed markets, emerging markets
- **Bonds**: Government, corporate, municipal
- **Real Estate**: REITs
- **Cash**: Money market, savings
- **Other**: Commodities, crypto, alternatives

**Calculate across ALL accounts**:

| Asset Class | 401k | IRA | Taxable | Total | % |
|-------------|------|-----|---------|-------|---|
| US Stocks | $30K | $10K | $15K | $55K | 55% |
| Int'l Stocks | $10K | $5K | $5K | $20K | 20% |
| Bonds | $10K | $5K | $0 | $15K | 15% |
| Cash | $0 | $0 | $10K | $10K | 10% |
| **Total** | $50K | $20K | $30K | $100K | 100% |

**Why view holistically**: Your 401k might be 80% stocks, but if your IRA is all bonds, total allocation is more balanced than any single account suggests.

### Phase 3: Target Allocation (10 minutes)

Define what your allocation should be.

**Factors determining target**:
1. **Time horizon**: Longer = more stocks
2. **Risk tolerance**: How much volatility can you stomach?
3. **Financial situation**: Stable income = more risk capacity
4. **Goals**: Growth vs. income vs. preservation

**Rule of thumb starting points**:
- Age in bonds (30 years old = 30% bonds)
- Or: 110 - age = stock percentage (30 years old = 80% stocks)

**Sample allocations by risk profile**:

| Profile | Stocks | Bonds | Expected Return | Max Drawdown |
|---------|--------|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| Aggressive | 90% | 10% | 8-10% | -50% |
| Growth | 80% | 20% | 7-9% | -40% |
| Moderate | 60% | 40% | 6-7% | -30% |
| Conservative | 40% | 60% | 4-5% | -20% |
| Preservation | 20% | 80% | 3-4% | -10% |

**Diversification within stocks**:
- US Large Cap: 40-50%
- US Small/Mid Cap: 10-20%
- International Developed: 20-30%
- Emerging Markets: 5-15%

**AskUserQuestion**: "Given your timeline and comfort with volatility, what allocation feels right?"

### Phase 4: Evaluate (15 minutes)

Assess performance, fees, and holdings quality.

**Performance review**:
- How did portfolio perform vs. benchmark?
- Was underperformance due to allocation or fund selection?
- Any individual holdings significantly underperforming?

**Appropriate benchmarks**:
- US Stocks: S&P 500 or Total US Market
- International: MSCI EAFE or All-World ex-US
- Bonds: Bloomberg Aggregate Bond
- Balanced: 60/40 blended benchmark

**Fee analysis**:

| Holding | Balance | Expense Ratio | Annual Cost |
|---------|---------|---------------|-------------|
| Fund A | $50,000 | 0.04% | $20 |
| Fund B | $30,000 | 0.85% | $255 |
| Fund C | $20,000 | 1.20% | $240 |
| **Total** | $100,000 | 0.52% avg | $515 |

**Fee impact**: 1% vs. 0.1% over 30 years on $100K = $100K difference

**Target**: Under 0.20% total expense ratio (index funds)

**Red flags**:
- Expense ratios over 0.5%
- Actively managed funds underperforming index
- Duplicate holdings (multiple large cap funds)
- Concentrated positions (>10% in single stock)

**AskUserQuestion**: "What funds are in your portfolio? Let's check the expense ratios."

### Phase 5: Rebalance (15 minutes)

Bring allocation back to target.

**When to rebalance**:
- Annual check (at minimum)
- When any asset class drifts 5%+ from target
- After major contribution or withdrawal
- After major life changes

**How to rebalance**:

**Option 1: New contributions** (tax-efficient)
- Direct new money to underweight asset classes
- No selling = no tax events
- Works for ongoing contributions

**Option 2: Sell and buy** (immediate)
- Sell overweight positions
- Buy underweight positions
- Prefer doing in tax-advantaged accounts (no tax impact)

**Option 3: Dividends/distributions**
- Direct reinvestments to underweight assets
- Gradual rebalancing without selling

**Tax-efficient location**:
- Tax-advantaged accounts (401k, IRA): Hold bonds, REITs (high tax distributions)
- Taxable accounts: Hold stocks, especially index funds (tax-efficient)

**Rebalancing example**:
- Current: 70% stocks / 30% bonds
- Target: 60% stocks / 40% bonds
- Total portfolio: $100,000
- Action: Sell $10,000 stocks, buy $10,000 bonds (in IRA to avoid taxes)

## Key Principles

**Why it works**:
- **Systematic discipline**: Removes emotion from investment decisions
- **Buy low, sell high**: Rebalancing naturally does this
- **Risk management**: Prevents portfolio drift into inappropriate risk levels
- **Simplicity**: You don't need to pick winners, just maintain allocation

**Core investment principles**:
1. **Diversification**: Don't put all eggs in one basket
2. **Low costs**: Fees are guaranteed drag on returns
3. **Time in market**: Beats timing the market
4. **Stay the course**: Changing strategy during volatility destroys returns

**The simple portfolio that beats most investors**:
- US Total Stock Market Index: 60%
- International Stock Index: 20%
- Total Bond Market Index: 20%
- Total expense ratio: ~0.05%

## Common Pitfalls

- **Checking too often**: Daily portfolio checks cause anxiety and poor decisions. Monthly at most, quarterly is fine.

- **Performance chasing**: Buying what went up last year. Past performance ≠ future results.

- **Overcomplicating**: More funds doesn't mean better diversification. 3-4 funds can be perfectly diversified.

- **Ignoring fees**: "It's only 1%" compounds to massive amounts over time.

- **Market timing**: Trying to avoid downturns usually means missing upturns. Stay invested.

- **Home country bias**: US investors often have too much US stock. International diversification reduces risk.

- **Panic selling**: Selling during downturns locks in losses. Downturns are buying opportunities.

- **Concentration risk**: Company stock in 401k over 10% is dangerous. Enron employees learned this.

## Special Situations

### Approaching Retirement (Within 10 years)

- Gradually reduce stock allocation
- Build 2-3 years of expenses in stable assets
- Consider bucket strategy (short/medium/long-term buckets)
- Sequence of returns risk is real - protect near-term needs

### Windfall or Large Contribution

**Lump sum vs. dollar-cost averaging**:
- Lump sum wins 2/3 of time (time in market)
- DCA wins psychologically (reduces regret if market drops)
- Compromise: Deploy over 3-6 months

### Market Crash Response

**What to do**:
1. Nothing (stay the course)
2. Rebalance into stocks (buy the dip systematically)
3. Tax-loss harvest (turn losses into tax savings)

**What NOT to do**:
1. Panic sell
2. Stop contributing
3. Check portfolio daily

## Examples

**Example 1: Annual review rebalance**

**Situation**: Target 80/20, currently 87/13 after strong stock year

**Portfolio**: $200,000
- Current stocks: $174,000 (87%)
- Current bonds: $26,000 (13%)
- Target stocks: $160,000 (80%)
- Target bonds: $40,000 (20%)

**Action**: In IRA, sell $14,000 stocks, buy $14,000 bonds

**Result**: Back to target allocation, systematically sold high (stocks up) and bought low (bonds down)

**Example 2: Fee reduction overhaul**

**Situation**: Inherited portfolio of actively managed funds

**Before**:
- 5 funds averaging 1.1% expense ratio
- Annual fee on $150,000: $1,650

**After** (converted to index funds):
- 3 index funds averaging 0.06% expense ratio
- Annual fee on $150,000: $90

**30-year impact**: ~$180,000 saved in fees (reinvested at 7%)

**Example 3: New investor simple setup**

**Situation**: Starting to invest, overwhelmed by choices

**Simple 3-fund portfolio**:
1. Vanguard Total Stock Market (VTI): 60%
2. Vanguard Total International (VXUS): 25%
3. Vanguard Total Bond Market (BND): 15%

**Why it works**:
- Total US market: ~4,000 US stocks
- Total international: ~7,000 non-US stocks
- Total bond: ~10,000 bonds
- Instant diversification across 20,000+ securities
- Total cost: 0.04% average expense ratio

**Action**: Set up automatic monthly contribution split across these three funds

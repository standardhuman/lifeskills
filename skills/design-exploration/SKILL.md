# Design Exploration

## Overview

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs through natural collaborative dialogue. This is the Socratic method applied to life decisions, business strategies, and personal projects.

Start by understanding the current context, then ask questions one at a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you're designing, present options in small sections (200-300 words), checking after each whether it looks right.

## Before Starting (Optional)

If you're feeling unclear or have mixed feelings:
- **Feeling stuck?** → Try self-connection first
- **Need creative ideas?** → Try brainstorming first
- **Ready to explore options?** → Continue below

## The Process

### Understanding the Situation

- Ask questions one at a time to clarify the situation
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible (easier to answer)
- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Key questions to explore:**
- What are you trying to accomplish?
- What constraints or limitations exist? (time, money, relationships, energy)
- What does success look like?
- What have you already tried or considered?
- What would make this feel resolved?

### Exploring Approaches

- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why
- Be honest about downsides of each approach

**Example framing:**
> "I see three ways to approach this:
>
> **Option A (Recommended):** [approach] - This makes sense because [reason]. Trade-off: [downside].
>
> **Option B:** [approach] - Better if [condition]. Trade-off: [downside].
>
> **Option C:** [approach] - Worth considering if [condition]. Trade-off: [downside].
>
> Which resonates with you, or should we explore any of these further?"

### Presenting the Design

Once you believe you understand the direction:
- Present the design in sections of 200-300 words
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far
- Cover relevant aspects: goals, actions, timeline, resources, contingencies
- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense

## After the Design

### Documentation
- Summarize the validated design clearly
- Include: goal, approach, key actions, success criteria
- Offer to document in a format useful to the user

### Next Steps
Ask: "Ready to create an action plan?"
- If yes → suggest project-planning skill for detailed breakdown
- If they need to decide between options first → suggest decision-making skill

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended when possible
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary complexity from designs
- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- **Incremental validation** - Present design in sections, validate each
- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense

## Applicable Domains

This skill works for:
- **Business:** Strategy, pricing, partnerships, product decisions
- **Financial:** Major purchases, investment approaches, debt strategies
- **Career:** Job changes, skill development, negotiation approaches
- **Personal:** Relationship decisions, living situations, life transitions
- **Creative:** Project approaches, learning paths, creative directions

## Skill Chaining

After completing design-exploration:
- **If need to choose between options** → decision-making
- **If ready to plan execution** → project-planning
- **If discovered emotional blocks** → self-connection

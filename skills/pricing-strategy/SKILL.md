# Pricing Strategy

## Overview

Framework for determining optimal pricing that captures value, supports business goals, and aligns with market positioning. Pricing is the most powerful lever for profitability - a 1% price increase typically yields 8-11% profit increase. Yet most businesses underprice out of fear.

**When to use**: Launching new product/service, reviewing existing pricing, losing deals on price, feeling undervalued, expanding offerings

## Quick Reference

## The Process

Copy this checklist using TodoWrite to track progress:

```
□ Phase 1: Quantify value delivered
□ Phase 2: Calculate cost floor
□ Phase 3: Research market rates
□ Phase 4: Choose positioning strategy
□ Phase 5: Design pricing structure
```

### Phase 1: Value (15 minutes)

Start with the value you create, not your costs.

**Value-based pricing question**: "What is the result worth to the customer?"

**Types of value**:
- **Revenue increase**: Will this help them make more money?
- **Cost reduction**: Will this save them money?
- **Time savings**: Will this save them time?
- **Risk reduction**: Will this protect them from loss?
- **Emotional value**: Status, peace of mind, enjoyment

**Quantifying value**:
1. What outcome does the customer get?
2. What is that outcome worth in dollars?
3. What percentage of that value is fair for you to capture?

**Example**:
- You help a client save $100,000/year in costs
- Value of outcome: $100,000
- Fair capture: 10-20% = $10,000-$20,000 fee

**The 10x rule**: Customers should get at least 10x the value of what they pay. If you charge $5,000, they should get $50,000+ in value.

**AskUserQuestion**: "What specific outcome does your product/service deliver? Can we quantify its value to the customer?"

### Phase 2: Cost (10 minutes)

Calculate your minimum viable price.

**Direct costs**:
- Time (your hourly rate × hours)
- Materials
- Software/tools
- Subcontractors
- Transaction fees

**Indirect costs** (allocate percentage):
- Overhead (rent, utilities, insurance)
- Marketing/sales cost
- Admin time
- Taxes

**Cost-plus formula**:
- Total cost + desired profit margin = minimum price
- Example: $2,000 cost + 50% margin = $3,000 minimum

**Important**: Cost sets the floor. Value sets the ceiling. Price somewhere between, usually closer to value.

**AskUserQuestion**: "What are your direct costs for delivering this product/service?"

### Phase 3: Market (15 minutes)

Understand competitive landscape.

**Research methods**:
- Competitors' public pricing pages
- Request quotes as potential customer
- Industry surveys and reports
- Talk to customers about what they've paid elsewhere
- Professional association rate guides

**Competitive analysis table**:

| Competitor | Price | What's Included | Positioning |
|------------|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| Competitor A | $X | Features... | Premium |
| Competitor B | $Y | Features... | Mid-market |
| Competitor C | $Z | Features... | Budget |
| **You** | $? | Features... | ? |

**Market positioning options**:
- **Premium** (top 10%): Highest price, best quality/service
- **Professional** (top 25%): Above average, quality focused
- **Market rate** (middle 50%): Competitive, balanced
- **Value** (bottom 25%): Lower price, efficient delivery
- **Budget** (bottom 10%): Lowest price, bare bones

**Don't compete on price alone**: Unless you have structural cost advantage, being cheapest is a race to the bottom.

**AskUserQuestion**: "What do competitors charge? Where do you want to position yourself?"

### Phase 4: Position (10 minutes)

Choose your pricing strategy.

**Strategy options**:

**Value-based pricing**:
- Price based on outcome value
- Best for: Custom services, consulting, high-impact products
- Example: Charge % of results delivered

**Premium pricing**:
- Highest price in market
- Requires: Superior quality, brand, or experience
- Best for: Differentiated offerings, quality-focused customers

**Competitive pricing**:
- Match or slightly beat competitors
- Best for: Commoditized offerings, price-sensitive markets
- Risk: Price wars, margin pressure

**Penetration pricing**:
- Start low to gain market share, raise later
- Best for: New markets, network effects
- Risk: Customers anchor on low price

**Anchor pricing**:
- Show high price first, then your price
- Creates perception of value/savings
- Example: "Normally $500, now $299"

**Tiered pricing**:
- Multiple options at different price points
- Lets customers self-select
- Middle tier usually sells most (decoy effect)

**AskUserQuestion**: "Based on your value and market position, which pricing strategy fits?"

### Phase 5: Structure (15 minutes)

Design the pricing model.

**Pricing models**:

**Fixed/project-based**:
- One price for defined scope
- Clear for customer, risk for you (scope creep)
- Best for: Well-defined projects

**Hourly/time-based**:
- Bill for time spent
- Flexible, but caps your income
- Best for: Variable scope, early relationships

**Retainer/subscription**:
- Recurring fee for ongoing access
- Predictable revenue
- Best for: Ongoing services, SaaS

**Value-based/performance**:
- Fee tied to results delivered
- Aligns incentives
- Best for: Measurable outcomes, high trust

**Tiered packages**:
- Good / Better / Best options
- Increases average sale
- Best for: Most B2B services

**Tiered pricing example**:

| Tier | Price | What's Included | Best For |
|------|-------|-----------------|----------|
| Basic | $997 | Core offering | Budget-conscious |
| Professional | $2,497 | Core + extras | Most customers |
| Premium | $4,997 | Everything + VIP | High-value customers |

**The decoy effect**: The middle option should be the sweet spot. Make Basic feel limited, Premium feel expensive, Professional feel "just right."

## Key Principles

**Why it works**:
- **Value capture**: You deserve fair compensation for value created
- **Signal quality**: Low prices signal low quality
- **Customer filtering**: Right prices attract right customers
- **Sustainability**: Healthy margins enable better service

**Pricing psychology**:
- **Anchor high**: First number seen sets expectations
- **Charm pricing**: $97 feels much less than $100
- **Round numbers**: Signal premium/quality
- **Show savings**: "Save $200" is powerful
- **Unbundle/bundle**: Depends on perception you want

**The underpricing trap**: Most service providers underprice by 30-50%. Signs you're underpriced:
- Fully booked with waiting list
- Customers never pushback on price
- You resent the work
- No margin for excellence

## Common Pitfalls

- **Pricing on cost, not value**: Your costs are irrelevant to the customer. Price on value delivered.

- **Fear of losing deals**: You'll lose some deals by pricing correctly. These are often the worst customers anyway.

- **Discounting too easily**: Every discount trains customers to ask for discounts. Hold your price, add value instead.

- **Hourly rate ceiling**: Trading time for money limits income. Move toward value-based or productized pricing.

- **Not raising prices**: Costs increase, skills improve, inflation happens. Review and raise prices annually.

- **Apologizing for price**: State price confidently. If you don't believe in it, neither will they.

## Raising Prices

**When to raise**:
- Demand exceeds capacity
- Skills/results have improved
- Costs have increased
- Annual review (minimum)

**How to raise**:
- New customers: Just change the price
- Existing customers: Give notice (30-90 days)
- Position as: Investment in quality, not cost increase

**Script for existing customers**:
"Starting [date], our rate will be [new price]. This reflects our continued investment in [quality/tools/team] and allows us to continue delivering [excellent results]. We value our relationship and want to give you advance notice."

## Examples

**Example 1: Consulting service pricing**

**Situation**: Business consultant, currently charging $150/hour, always busy

**Value analysis**:
- Average client engagement: 20 hours = $3,000
- Average client result: $50,000 profit increase
- Value ratio: Client gets 16x value (too low for consultant)

**New pricing**:
- Move from hourly to project-based
- "Strategy Sprint" package: $8,000 for defined outcome
- Value ratio now: Client gets 6x value (healthy)

**Result**: 2.6x revenue per engagement, better clients, better outcomes

**Example 2: SaaS tiered pricing**

**Situation**: Software product, single price point at $29/month

**New tiered structure**:
- Starter: $19/month (limited features, 1 user)
- Professional: $49/month (full features, 5 users)
- Team: $99/month (full features, unlimited users, priority support)

**Result**:
- Some customers downgrade to $19 (acceptable)
- Most move to $49 (revenue increase)
- Enterprise customers choose $99 (revenue increase)
- Average revenue per user increases 40%

**Example 3: Service business premium positioning**

**Situation**: Photographer charging market rate ($2,500 for wedding)

**Premium repositioning**:
- Raised price to $6,000
- Added: Album, engagement session, second shooter
- Reduced: Volume (fewer weddings per year)

**Result**:
- Lost 40% of inquiries (wrong customers)
- Booking rate on remaining inquiries: Higher (price = quality signal)
- Revenue: Same total, 40% less work
- Quality: Better work on fewer projects
- Referrals: Premium customers refer premium customers

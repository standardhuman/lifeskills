# Retirement Planning

## Overview

Framework for determining retirement needs, choosing the right accounts, and building a sustainable retirement plan. The goal: replace your income with investment returns so work becomes optional. Start with the end in mind and work backward to today's actions.

**When to use**: Starting to save for retirement, evaluating 401k options, wondering if you're on track, planning early retirement, approaching retirement age

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Action | Time |
|-------|--------|------|
| 1. Envision | Define retirement lifestyle | 10 min |
| 2. Calculate | Determine your number | 15 min |
| 3. Assess | Where are you now? | 10 min |
| 4. Plan | Choose accounts and allocation | 15 min |
| 5. Execute | Set up contributions | 10 min |

**Total time**: 45-60 minutes for initial plan

## The Process

Copy this checklist using TodoWrite to track progress:

```
□ Phase 1: Define retirement vision
□ Phase 2: Calculate retirement number
□ Phase 3: Assess current position
□ Phase 4: Choose accounts and strategy
□ Phase 5: Implement contribution plan
```

### Phase 1: Envision (10 minutes)

Define what retirement looks like for you.

**Key questions**:
1. What age do you want to retire? (Traditional 65? Early 50s? Never fully?)
2. Where do you want to live? (Same place, downsize, relocate?)
3. What will you do? (Travel, hobbies, part-time work?)
4. What lifestyle level? (Maintain current? Simpler? More luxurious?)

**Retirement expense estimation**:
- Most people need 70-80% of pre-retirement income
- Some need more (travel plans, hobbies)
- Some need less (no commute, paid-off house, no kids at home)

**AskUserQuestion**: "When do you want to retire, and what does your ideal retirement look like?"

### Phase 2: Calculate (15 minutes)

Determine your "retirement number."

**The 4% Rule (Simple Method)**:
- Annual retirement expenses × 25 = Retirement number
- Example: $60,000/year × 25 = $1,500,000

**Why 25×**: Research shows you can withdraw 4% annually with high probability of not running out over 30 years.

**More conservative (3.5% rule)**:
- Annual expenses × 28.5 = Retirement number
- Safer for early retirement or uncertain markets

**Factors that adjust your number**:
- **Social Security**: Reduces needed savings (estimate at ssa.gov)
- **Pension**: Reduces needed savings
- **Part-time work**: Reduces withdrawal needs
- **Early retirement**: Need more (longer time horizon)
- **Healthcare costs**: Need more (until Medicare at 65)

**Calculation worksheet**:
1. Desired annual spending: $______
2. Minus Social Security (estimate): $______
3. Minus pension (if any): $______
4. Net needed from investments: $______
5. Multiply by 25: $______ (your number)

**AskUserQuestion**: "What do you estimate your annual retirement expenses will be?"

### Phase 3: Assess (10 minutes)

Where are you now relative to your goal?

**Gather current retirement savings**:
- 401(k) / 403(b) balances
- IRA balances (Traditional and Roth)
- Other investment accounts
- Pension value (if applicable)

**Calculate your gap**:
- Retirement number: $______
- Current savings: $______
- Gap to close: $______
- Years until retirement: ______

**Required savings rate**:
Use compound interest calculators to determine monthly savings needed.

**Rough benchmarks by age** (as multiple of salary):
- Age 30: 1× salary saved
- Age 40: 3× salary saved
- Age 50: 6× salary saved
- Age 60: 8× salary saved
- Age 67: 10× salary saved

**AskUserQuestion**: "What are your current retirement account balances?"

### Phase 4: Plan (15 minutes)

Choose the right accounts and investment strategy.

**Account priority order** (generally):
1. **401k up to employer match** - Free money (100% return)
2. **Pay off high-interest debt** - Guaranteed high return
3. **HSA (if eligible)** - Triple tax advantage
4. **Roth IRA** - Tax-free growth, flexibility
5. **401k up to max** - Tax-deferred growth
6. **Taxable brokerage** - After maxing tax-advantaged

**2024 Contribution limits**:
- 401(k): $23,000 ($30,500 if 50+)
- IRA: $7,000 ($8,000 if 50+)
- HSA: $4,150 individual / $8,300 family

**Traditional vs. Roth decision**:
- **Traditional**: Tax deduction now, taxed at withdrawal
  - Better if: High tax bracket now, expect lower in retirement
- **Roth**: No deduction now, tax-free at withdrawal
  - Better if: Lower tax bracket now, expect higher in retirement, or want flexibility

**Investment allocation by age** (rule of thumb):
- Stocks percentage = 110 - your age
- Age 30: 80% stocks, 20% bonds
- Age 50: 60% stocks, 40% bonds
- Age 65: 45% stocks, 55% bonds

**Simple portfolio**: Target-date fund matching your retirement year (e.g., Vanguard Target 2050)

**AskUserQuestion**: "What retirement accounts do you currently have access to? Does your employer offer a match?"

### Phase 5: Execute (10 minutes)

Set up your contribution strategy.

**Actions**:
1. Increase 401k contribution to at least get full match
2. Set up automatic IRA contributions
3. Choose investments (target-date or simple 3-fund portfolio)
4. Set calendar reminder for annual increase

**The 1% annual increase**: Each year, increase contribution by 1% of salary. You won't notice it, but over 20 years it transforms your retirement.

**Automation**: Set contributions to happen automatically on payday. What you don't see, you don't spend.

**AskUserQuestion**: "Based on our analysis, are you ready to increase your retirement contributions?"

## Key Principles

**Why it works**:
- **Compound growth**: Time is the most powerful factor. Starting early matters more than contributing more later.
- **Tax advantages**: Tax-deferred and tax-free growth dramatically accelerates wealth building
- **Automation**: Consistent contributions beat timing the market
- **Employer match**: Never leave free money on the table

**The power of starting early**:
- Save $500/month from age 25-35 (10 years), then stop = $1.1M at 65
- Save $500/month from age 35-65 (30 years) = $1.0M at 65
- Same total contribution, earlier start wins

**Rule of 72**: 72 ÷ return rate = years to double
- 7% return: Money doubles every ~10 years
- $100K at 35 → $200K at 45 → $400K at 55 → $800K at 65

## Common Pitfalls

- **Waiting to start**: "I'll save more when I make more" loses the most powerful wealth-building years. Start now with whatever you can.

- **Not getting the full match**: Employer match is 100% return. This should be priority #1.

- **Cashing out when changing jobs**: Rolling over to IRA preserves tax advantages. Cashing out loses ~40% to taxes and penalties.

- **Being too conservative young**: At 25, you have 40 years. Stock market volatility is noise over that timeframe. Being in bonds loses growth.

- **Being too aggressive near retirement**: At 60, a 50% market drop is devastating. Shift to more conservative allocation.

- **Ignoring fees**: 1% vs. 0.1% in fees = hundreds of thousands over a career. Choose low-cost index funds.

- **Trying to time the market**: Time in market beats timing the market. Consistent contributions through ups and downs wins.

## Special Situations

### Playing Catch-Up (Starting Late)

If you're behind:
1. Max out catch-up contributions (50+ age bonus)
2. Delay retirement 2-3 years (huge impact)
3. Reduce retirement expenses (more realistic target)
4. Plan for part-time work in early retirement
5. Downsize housing to free up equity

### Early Retirement (FIRE)

Financial Independence, Retire Early requires:
- Higher savings rate (50%+ of income)
- Lower target spending
- Bridge strategy for before 59.5 (avoid penalties)
- Roth conversion ladder
- Healthcare solution until Medicare

**FIRE number**: Annual expenses × 25-33 (more conservative)

### Self-Employed

Options:
- **SEP-IRA**: Up to 25% of net earnings (max $69,000 in 2024)
- **Solo 401(k)**: Employee + employer contributions
- **SIMPLE IRA**: Lower limits but easier

## Examples

**Example 1: Young professional starting out**

**Situation**: Age 28, salary $70,000, no retirement savings, employer offers 4% match

**Calculation**:
- Retirement goal: $50,000/year spending
- Social Security estimate: $20,000/year
- Net needed: $30,000/year × 25 = $750,000

**Plan**:
- Contribute 6% to 401k ($4,200/year + $2,800 match = $7,000/year)
- At 7% return: $750,000 by age 60 with these contributions alone
- Increase 1% annually to accelerate

**Action**: Log into HR portal, set 401k contribution to 6%

---

**Example 2: Mid-career catch-up**

**Situation**: Age 45, salary $100,000, $150,000 saved, wants to retire at 65

**Calculation**:
- Retirement goal: $70,000/year
- Social Security estimate: $25,000/year
- Net needed: $45,000/year × 25 = $1,125,000

**Gap analysis**:
- Current: $150,000 → grows to ~$580,000 at 65 (7% return)
- Gap: $545,000 needed
- Required: ~$1,100/month for 20 years

**Plan**:
- Max 401k: $23,000/year ($1,917/month)
- Max IRA: $7,000/year ($583/month)
- Total: $2,500/month (above requirement, builds buffer)

**Action**: Increase 401k to max, open IRA and set up automatic contribution

---

**Example 3: Early retirement plan**

**Situation**: Age 35, salary $120,000, $200,000 saved, wants to retire at 50

**Calculation**:
- 15 years until retirement
- Target spending: $40,000/year × 30 (conservative for early retirement) = $1,200,000
- No Social Security until 67 (17 years of bridge funding needed)

**Plan**:
- Save 50% of income ($60,000/year)
- Current $200K grows to ~$550K
- 15 years of $60K/year at 7% = ~$1,580K
- Total: ~$2.1M (provides large safety margin)

**Bridge strategy**:
- Years 50-59.5: Taxable brokerage + Roth contributions (not gains)
- Years 59.5+: Traditional 401k/IRA accessible
- Build Roth conversion ladder starting at 50

**Action**: Maximize all accounts, invest excess in taxable brokerage, track FIRE progress monthly

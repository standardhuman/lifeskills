# Big Purchases

## Overview

Decision framework for major purchases to ensure alignment with values, financial health, and long-term goals. Prevents impulse decisions on items that significantly impact your finances. Use for any purchase that would take more than a week's income or significantly affect your budget.

**When to use**: Considering buying a car, house, furniture, electronics over $500, vacation, any purchase causing financial anxiety

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Question | Time |
|-------|----------|------|
| 1. Pause | Is this a want or a need? | 5 min |
| 2. Afford | Can I actually afford this? | 10 min |
| 3. Align | Does this serve my values/goals? | 10 min |
| 4. Optimize | Is this the best way to meet the need? | 15 min |
| 5. Decide | Buy, wait, or pass? | 5 min |

**Total time**: 30-45 minutes (saves potentially thousands)

## The Process

Copy this checklist using TodoWrite to track progress:

```
□ Phase 1: Pause - want vs. need
□ Phase 2: Afford - financial reality check
□ Phase 3: Align - values alignment
□ Phase 4: Optimize - alternatives analysis
□ Phase 5: Decide - final decision
```

### Phase 1: Pause (5 minutes)

Create space between impulse and action.

**The 24-hour rule**: For any purchase over $100, wait 24 hours. For major purchases, wait 1 week minimum.

**Questions to ask**:
1. Is this a want or a need? (Be honest)
2. What triggered this desire? (Ad, social comparison, genuine need?)
3. How long have I wanted this? (Impulse vs. considered)
4. What problem am I trying to solve?

**Want vs. Need distinction**:
- **Need**: Required for basic functioning, safety, or earning income
- **Want**: Would improve life but not essential

**AskUserQuestion**: "What purchase are you considering? Is it a want or a need? What problem does it solve?"

### Phase 2: Afford (10 minutes)

Financial reality check - can you actually afford this?

**The real affordability test**:
1. Can you pay cash without touching emergency fund?
2. If financing, is the monthly payment under 10% of take-home pay?
3. Will this purchase delay other financial goals?
4. Would you still buy it at 20% higher price? (Accounts for total cost)

**True cost calculation**:
- Purchase price
- Sales tax
- Financing interest (total, not monthly)
- Maintenance/insurance/ongoing costs
- Opportunity cost (what else could this money do?)

**Example**: $30,000 car
- Price: $30,000
- Tax: $2,400
- Interest (5yr, 6%): $4,800
- Insurance increase: $1,200/year × 5 = $6,000
- **True 5-year cost**: $43,200

**AskUserQuestion**: "What's the purchase price? Let's calculate the true cost including all associated expenses."

### Phase 3: Align (10 minutes)

Does this purchase align with your values and goals?

**Values check**:
1. Which of your core values does this serve?
2. Does it conflict with any values?
3. Will future-you thank present-you?

**Goals check**:
1. Does this help or hurt your financial goals?
2. How many months of [goal] progress does this cost?
3. Is this purchase more important than your goals?

**The 10/10/10 rule**:
- How will I feel about this purchase in 10 minutes?
- How will I feel in 10 months?
- How will I feel in 10 years?

**AskUserQuestion**: "What are your current financial goals? How does this purchase affect them?"

### Phase 4: Optimize (15 minutes)

Is this the best way to meet the underlying need?

**Alternative analysis**:
1. Could you buy used instead of new?
2. Is there a less expensive option that's 80% as good?
3. Could you rent, borrow, or share instead of buying?
4. Could you delay 6 months? Would circumstances change?
5. Is there a different solution to the underlying problem?

**The 80% rule**: Often a product at 50% of the price delivers 80% of the value. The premium is for the last 20%.

**Research checklist**:
- Compare at least 3 alternatives
- Read reviews (prioritize 3-star reviews for balanced perspective)
- Check for seasonal sales or negotiation opportunities
- Calculate cost-per-use for lifespan of item

**AskUserQuestion**: "What alternatives have you considered? Let's explore options."

### Phase 5: Decide (5 minutes)

Make the final call with full information.

**Decision matrix**:

| Factor | Weight | Score (1-5) | Weighted |
|--------|--------|-------------|----------|
| Affordability | 30% | | |
| Values alignment | 25% | | |
| Solves real problem | 25% | | |
| Best option available | 20% | | |
| **Total** | 100% | | |

**Decision options**:
- **Buy now**: Passes all checks, ready to purchase
- **Buy later**: Good purchase but timing is wrong (save up first)
- **Buy different**: Need is real but this isn't the right solution
- **Pass**: Doesn't pass the tests, don't buy

**If still uncertain**: That's a signal. Uncertainty usually means "not yet" or "not this."

**AskUserQuestion**: "Based on our analysis, what's your decision: buy now, buy later, buy different, or pass?"

## Key Principles

**Why it works**:
- **Impulse prevention**: Time and analysis defeat emotional purchasing
- **True cost awareness**: Sticker price is never the real price
- **Values integration**: Purchases should serve your life, not complicate it
- **Optimization mindset**: The goal is solving the problem, not buying the thing

**The purchase regret pattern**: Most regretted purchases share common traits:
- Impulse (decided quickly)
- Social pressure (others have it)
- Financed (couldn't afford cash)
- Unused (didn't solve real problem)

## Special Cases

### Financing Decisions

If you must finance:
- Interest rate under 5%: Acceptable for appreciating assets
- Interest rate 5-10%: Only for true necessities
- Interest rate over 10%: Almost never worth it
- 0% financing: Still affects cash flow; treat as if paying cash

**Question**: If you can't save up for it in a reasonable time, can you really afford the payments?

### Housing Purchases

Additional considerations:
- Total monthly housing cost under 28% of gross income
- Total debt payments under 36% of gross income
- Plan to stay 5+ years (recoup transaction costs)
- Emergency fund separate from down payment
- Factor in maintenance (1-2% of home value annually)

### Vehicle Purchases

Additional considerations:
- Total vehicle costs under 15% of take-home pay
- Consider total cost of ownership (fuel, insurance, maintenance)
- Depreciation: New cars lose 20% year one
- The 20/4/10 rule: 20% down, 4-year max loan, 10% of income max payment

## Common Pitfalls

- **"I deserve this"**: Deserving has nothing to do with affording. You deserve financial security more than any purchase.

- **"It's on sale"**: A discount on something you don't need is not savings. 50% off a $1000 item you wouldn't buy at $500 is $500 spent, not $500 saved.

- **"I'll make more money soon"**: Budget for current income. Future income buys future things.

- **"It's an investment"**: Most consumer purchases are not investments. Cars, electronics, furniture depreciate. Be honest about what's an investment vs. a purchase.

- **"Everyone else has one"**: Comparison is the thief of financial peace. Others' purchases often hide debt and stress.

- **"I need it for work"**: Sometimes true. Often rationalization. Be rigorous about what's actually required vs. nice to have.

## Examples

**Example 1: New laptop consideration**

**Situation**: Current laptop is 5 years old, considering $2,000 MacBook Pro

**Phase 1 - Pause**: Want or need? Current laptop still works but slow. Want (upgrade) not need (replacement).

**Phase 2 - Afford**: Can pay cash, won't affect emergency fund. ✓

**Phase 3 - Align**: Values creativity and efficiency. Faster laptop = more creative output. Goal impact: delays house down payment by 2 months.

**Phase 4 - Optimize**:
- Refurbished MacBook: $1,400 (same specs)
- MacBook Air: $1,200 (90% of capability)
- Current laptop + SSD upgrade: $200

**Phase 5 - Decide**: SSD upgrade first. Revisit in 6 months if still slow.

**Outcome**: $200 spent, laptop runs great, $1,800 stays toward house goal.

**Example 2: Car purchase**

**Situation**: Current car needs $3,000 repair, considering new $35,000 car

**Phase 1 - Pause**: Emotional response to repair bill. Wait 1 week.

**Phase 2 - Afford**: Could finance but would stretch budget. Monthly payment = 18% of take-home (over 10% threshold).

**Phase 3 - Align**: Financial independence goal. New car delays by 2 years.

**Phase 4 - Optimize**:
- Repair current car: $3,000 (might last 3+ more years)
- Used reliable car: $15,000
- New base model: $28,000
- New desired model: $35,000

**Phase 5 - Decide**: Repair current car. Save $500/month toward replacement. Buy used car in 2 years when savings = $12,000.

**Outcome**: $3,000 repair saved $32,000 in avoided financing, maintained goal progress.

**Example 3: Vacation decision**

**Situation**: Dream vacation opportunity, $5,000 total cost

**Phase 1 - Pause**: Genuine desire for years, not impulse.

**Phase 2 - Afford**: Would use emergency fund. Does not pass. ✗

**Phase 3 - Align**: Values experiences and adventure. But security is also a value.

**Phase 4 - Optimize**:
- Same destination, off-season: $3,500
- Similar experience, different destination: $2,500
- Staycation + local adventures: $500

**Phase 5 - Decide**: Start vacation sinking fund. $400/month for 8 months. Book trip next year.

**Outcome**: Dream vacation happens without debt or emergency fund impact.

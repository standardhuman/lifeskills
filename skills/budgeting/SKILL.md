# Budgeting

## Overview

Zero-based monthly budgeting to allocate every dollar to a purpose before the month begins. Transforms money from a source of stress into a tool you control. Takes 30-45 minutes initially, 15 minutes for monthly maintenance.

**When to use**: Beginning of month, after income changes, feeling uncertain about spending, wanting to save more, before major financial decisions

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Action | Time |
|-------|--------|------|
| 1. Income | Calculate total expected income | 5 min |
| 2. Fixed | List non-negotiable expenses | 5 min |
| 3. Variable | Estimate flexible spending | 10 min |
| 4. Goals | Allocate to savings/debt | 10 min |
| 5. Balance | Adjust until income - expenses = 0 | 10 min |

**Total time**: 30-45 minutes (first time), 15 minutes (monthly)

## The Process

Copy this checklist using TodoWrite to track progress:

```
□ Phase 1: Calculate income
□ Phase 2: List fixed expenses
□ Phase 3: Estimate variable expenses
□ Phase 4: Allocate to goals
□ Phase 5: Balance to zero
```

### Phase 1: Income (5 minutes)

Calculate all expected income for the month.

**Income sources to include**:
- Salary/wages (after tax)
- Side income/freelance
- Investment income
- Rental income
- Any other regular income

**Key principle**: Use conservative estimates. If income varies, use the lowest expected amount. Windfalls get allocated when they arrive, not before.

**AskUserQuestion**: "What income do you expect this month? List all sources."

### Phase 2: Fixed Expenses (5 minutes)

List expenses that don't change month to month.

**Common fixed expenses**:
- Rent/mortgage
- Car payment
- Insurance (health, auto, home)
- Subscriptions (streaming, gym, software)
- Loan payments
- Phone bill
- Internet
- Childcare/tuition

**Actions**:
1. Review bank statements for recurring charges
2. List each fixed expense with exact amount
3. Note payment dates to ensure cash flow timing

**AskUserQuestion**: "What are your fixed monthly expenses? I'll help you list them all."

### Phase 3: Variable Expenses (10 minutes)

Estimate flexible spending categories.

**Common variable categories**:
- Groceries
- Gas/transportation
- Dining out/entertainment
- Clothing
- Personal care
- Household items
- Pet expenses
- Gifts

**How to estimate**:
1. Review last 3 months of spending in each category
2. Average the amounts
3. Adjust based on known upcoming needs (holiday gifts, etc.)

**The envelope method**: Think of each category as an envelope of cash. When it's empty, you stop spending in that category until next month.

**AskUserQuestion**: "Let's estimate your variable spending. What categories do you typically spend on?"

### Phase 4: Goals Allocation (10 minutes)

Allocate remaining income to financial goals.

**Priority order (general)**:
1. Emergency fund (1 month expenses minimum, then 3-6 months)
2. High-interest debt payoff (credit cards, etc.)
3. Retirement contribution (at least employer match)
4. Other savings goals (house, car, vacation)
5. Extra debt payoff
6. Additional investing

**The 50/30/20 guideline**:
- 50% needs (fixed + essential variable)
- 30% wants (discretionary)
- 20% savings/debt

**AskUserQuestion**: "What are your financial goals? Let's prioritize where extra money should go."

### Phase 5: Balance to Zero (10 minutes)

Adjust until every dollar is assigned.

**The zero-based principle**: Income - All Expenses - All Savings = $0

**If you have money left over**:
- Add to savings goals
- Increase debt payments
- Build emergency fund
- Create a "fun money" category

**If you're over budget**:
- Cut variable expenses (dining out, entertainment first)
- Review subscriptions for cuts
- Find ways to increase income
- Be realistic about what you can actually cut

**AskUserQuestion**: "Your budget shows [surplus/deficit]. How would you like to adjust?"

## Budget Tracking

### During the Month

**Weekly check-in** (5 minutes):
1. Review actual spending vs. budget
2. Adjust remaining allocation if needed
3. Celebrate wins, course-correct overspending

**Tools**:
- Spreadsheet (simple, full control)
- YNAB (You Need A Budget - best for zero-based)
- Mint/Personal Capital (automatic tracking)
- Pen and paper (if that works for you)

### End of Month

**Review questions**:
1. Which categories went over/under?
2. Were estimates realistic?
3. What adjustments for next month?
4. Did you hit your savings goals?

## Key Principles

**Source**: Zero-based budgeting, Dave Ramsey, YNAB methodology

**Why it works**:
- **Every dollar has a job** - No money "disappears" when it's all assigned
- **Proactive vs. reactive** - You decide where money goes before it arrives
- **Permission to spend** - Budgeted fun money is guilt-free
- **Awareness** - You can't improve what you don't measure

**Core insight**: A budget isn't restriction, it's permission. When you budget $100 for dining out, you spend that $100 guilt-free. Without a budget, every purchase carries anxiety.

## Common Pitfalls

- **"I'll track spending instead of budget"**: Tracking looks backward. Budgeting looks forward. Tracking tells you where money went; budgeting tells it where to go.

- **Making it too complicated**: Start with 10-15 categories max. You can refine later. Complexity kills consistency.

- **Not including irregular expenses**: Car registration, annual subscriptions, gifts. Divide by 12 and save monthly for these "sinking funds."

- **Giving up after one month**: The first 2-3 months are calibration. You're learning your real spending patterns. Adjust and continue.

- **Not budgeting windfalls**: Bonus, tax refund, gift money - budget it immediately or it evaporates. "Found money" is the easiest to waste.

- **Both partners not aligned**: If you share finances, budget together. Imposed budgets create resentment and secret spending.

## Examples

**Example 1: Simple single income budget**

**Income**: $4,500/month (after tax)

**Fixed Expenses** ($2,100):
- Rent: $1,200
- Car payment: $350
- Insurance: $200
- Phone/internet: $150
- Subscriptions: $100
- Student loan: $100

**Variable Expenses** ($1,100):
- Groceries: $400
- Gas: $150
- Dining out: $200
- Entertainment: $100
- Personal care: $100
- Household: $100
- Misc: $50

**Goals** ($1,300):
- Emergency fund: $300
- Retirement (401k): $500
- Vacation fund: $200
- Extra debt payment: $300

**Balance**: $4,500 - $2,100 - $1,100 - $1,300 = $0 ✓

**Example 2: Irregular income (freelancer)**

**Approach**:
1. Budget based on minimum expected income ($3,000)
2. Create priority list for extra income
3. When income exceeds minimum, allocate to priorities in order

**Priority list**:
1. Next month's expenses (build 1 month buffer)
2. Taxes (set aside 25-30%)
3. Emergency fund
4. Retirement
5. Business investment
6. Personal goals

**Key**: The buffer month removes feast/famine stress. You're always living on last month's income.

**Example 3: Getting out of paycheck-to-paycheck**

**Situation**: No savings, barely making it each month

**Strategy**:
1. Track every expense for 30 days (awareness first)
2. Identify 3 cuts (subscriptions, dining out, impulse purchases)
3. Start with $50/month to savings (small wins build momentum)
4. Increase savings by $25 each month as you optimize

**First month**: Cut $150 in unnecessary spending → $50 to emergency fund, $100 to smallest debt

**Six months later**: $500 emergency fund, one debt paid off, new habits formed
